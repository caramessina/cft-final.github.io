    <h1>Explore the Interviews</h1>

    <p>Explore the different themes that emerge across the six interviews with the fan authors. These themes were used to qualitatively code the interviews (<a href="/interviews/qualitative_coding.html">read more about this process here</a>). Important abbreviations — <cite>The Legend of Korra</cite> (TLOK), <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> (GOT), <cite>Archive of Our Own</cite> (AO3) — will be used in the analysis.</p>

      <p>Each of these themes provides:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a <strong>definition</strong> for how these themes were coded in the interview,</li>
        <li>the <strong>number</strong> of times each theme appeared across the interviews,</li>
        <li>a brief <strong>analysis</strong> and summary of how these themes emerged during the interviews,
        <li>fan authors' actual <strong>quotes</strong> from the interviews that were coded with these themes.</li>
      </ul>

           <h3>Quotes</h3>
           <ul>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>People write political theory when they write fanfic, like a lot of fanfic is political
                 theory, a lot of fanfiction is political.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>When I'm writing this fic it means something, because I'm like... There's a study
                 I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about things you don't
                 convince them, but if you tell stories you can. And I think that I'm in that place,
                 arguing about politics in the fiction space of the internet.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
                 context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
                 very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
                 you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
                 original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
                 through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
                 and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
                 with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
                 get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
                 you.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
                 a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
                 different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
                 in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
                 and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
                 looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>but this is what I was doing with my life. I was on my way to running a queer resource
                 center at a college, so I was doing the work of feeling the political implications
                 of things in the world. And so I was, for me the most natural thing to write about
                 is to write about... Not just homophobia, although this was a story about homophobia,
                 not just homophobia, but this was a story about queerness and politics. And because
                 this was the thing that was radicalizing me, [inaudible] is vile, because... And it
                 was about violence, so I don't just mean violence as a method of resistance, I mean
                 violence as a thing that people survive. Because that's what's radicalizing me at
                 the time. And so I felt the need to wake up that in a sense.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I come away from Korra feeling like, "This is a gender thing going on." I don't buy
                 that there's not homophobia in a world with gender in the like weird way that... In
                 ways that still reflect our I think gender and homophobia [inaudible 00:21:13], the
                 way that we have a sense of gender. Big, capital G Gender. And so I thought like,
                 "What does it mean to have culture in the context of... What does it mean to be a
                 cosmopolitan city where... There's both a degree of marginalization for like the Northern
                 Water Tribe closing... Not so much that rules that are really intended to enforce
                 gender norms are going to be there. And also to be like, "Yeah, there's probably a
                 different understanding of gender in context," yeah.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was trying to write a story that engaged with trauma and felt authentic and didn't
                 make trauma seem like the end of the world. Because the binary that's in a lot of
                 literature is either like, "Oh, you either overcame trauma, or you are doomed to misery
                 forever." And I was trying to find some middle ground, trying to tell a story that
                 felt authentic.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Whereas Korra grows up in this institution, Asami grows up with a relatively politically
                 progressive father. He's an abuser, but he's also a very, very politically progressive
                 man. He's a radical, he tries to overthrow his government, make the world a more equitable
                 and fair place. It's self-interested, he's a bourgeois radical, but I wouldn't have
                 said that at the time. I imagine Asami as having a relatively normal, relatively healthy
                 understanding of the world in a way, having felt like she, not just knowing that a
                 woman can love another woman, because I guess almost every person in this world knows.
                 This is nothing like, Korra is particularly going to have a hard time because of that
                 institution itself.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So to me, Hiroshi's both a man that would destroy his children for the things he believes,
                 and in some sense for his own power. But also a man who genuinely is providing aid
                 and comfort and resources for fighting for what he views as liberation, and that liberation's
                 probably genuine at some level. I think it's fair to say that there is a political
                 bender-like supremacy at the beginning. I mean there is, we know there's a bender
                 supremacy at the beginning of The Legend of Korra. And so that's how I understand
                 Hiroshi.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
                 a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
                 but it's good.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It sort of leaves a lot of space for the development of [inaudible 00:47:39], some
                 of the Equalist Asami stuff, and some of the discussion that comes out of that. So
                 I think that's very, very fertile ground for fanfic, and I think that it's liberating
                 for a lot of folks. So it drives a lot of views.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
                 love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
                 stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
                 of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
                 of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
                 "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
                 who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
                 of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yes. I think my most recent published fanfiction is a
                 Percy Weasley, second person point of view, post canon. In which he is attempting
                 to
                 basically restructure his society by running on a platform of big structural change.
                 Which might sound vaguely familiar.  But it was, I
                 think, mostly due to the kind of deep rage that I was feeling over the entire
                 Democratic Primaries over the past couple of months. And almost the past year.
                 In which everything felt very much like a lot of talk, and not a lot of doing.
                 And at some point, you need some catharsis. And kind of putting it out into
                 fiction and seeing something changing. Or, not even seeing something changing.
                 But seeing people trying to effect change, and willing to fight for that change
                 felt very important to me. And basically that entire fanfic is kind of born out
                 of that seething, massive, "I want to see something happening."
                 And I will see it happen in fiction, if not in reality.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I chose to make it Desi because I am Desi. and I wanted
                 to experience it.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that used second person point of
                 view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
                 you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
                 of
                 view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
                 what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
                 more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think a lot of the research and a lot of the material
                 was just about identifying and pulling disparate ideas together that I knew.
                 From either my own culture because, of course,
                 this is partially my own culture. And also, the historical
                 details of [inaudible 00:27:49].</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, obviously, race bending is, and can
                 be, very racist if not done in a very respectful manner.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the reason I did the Jodhaa Akbar tag was actually
                 because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
                 other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
                 fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
                 particular tag.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
                 I obviously can't give an explanation for a lot of these. But I think that they
                 make sense, to a certain extent, because there definitely are a lot more
                 heterosexual relationships within this fandom than I've seen in a lot of other
                 fandoms. And I think that's probably because we don't have one
                 main character and one side character that's like the sidekick to the main
                 character, both of them being male. You don't have that here.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
                 very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
                 queer
                 characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
                 go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
                 their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
                 situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>so it was, when I think I started it, Korrasami hadn't
                 been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
                 And maybe, I think,
                 during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
                 different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
                 strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I know a lot of people like to have full sentences, and
                 get really detailed and say things like that, but I always find that to be sort of
                 distracting, because I know, when I'm personally looking for something, I like to
                 be
                 able to just click through until I find exactly what I'm looking for. So, if
                 somebody has what I'm looking for, but also in that same tag is a full sentence of
                 something else, it doesn't necessarily help me stuff. If somebody's specifically
                 looking for, I guess a long-distance relationship thing, they can just click on that
                 and see, "Okay, well, it's in here somewhere. I'll just find whichever prompt it
                 is." I'm a big fan of just keeping things neat and simple.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And then, just
                 seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
                 once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
                 not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
                 the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
                 there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
                 </li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
                 it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
                 since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
                 until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
                 a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
                 decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
                 this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
                 case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
                 Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
                 bit.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
                 it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
                 press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" Because I just find keeping people as
                 slaves is super ... I didn't want to
                 contribute to it, and it was just that sort of idea
                 [inaudible 00:47:42] maybe are younger and a little bit
                 more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
                 been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
                 thing.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Obviously, there's always going to be people who say,
                 "I want a female ship. Going for it. I don't
                 care whether or not they necessarily gel." I'm sure there's
                 people ... I feel like I went back a million years ago and looked at the first
                 Korrasami fics, just out of curiosity, to see when they were published, and I'm sure
                 that they were like episode one, because it's just what people do, and it's great.
                 Ships are meant to be fun, they're not always meant to be canon.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, it was there, but
                 it's not surprising that a lot of people who aren't looking for it don't go and see
                 it. A lot of
                 straight people I know will look at a lot of these relationships and say, "Oh,
                 that came from nowhere."</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>At the end of season three, we saw that development and
                 we saw, especially during Korra's fight with Zaheer, Asami looked the most scared
                 out of everybody, and her reaction to her offer to stay with Korra through her
                 recovery, and help any way she can was sort of, "That's a little gayer than it maybe
                 should be," that sort of look. So, a lot
                 of people took that and decided to go with it, especially since
                 the relationship was [inaudible 01:00:21], whether or not ...
                 Again, and at that time, we didn't know the writer's intention, so it was just
                 everybody, or at least Korrasami fans, picking
                 up on it and saying, "Okay, well, we don't know when season four is happening,
                 so we're just going to kick off from there and this is what could
                 happen."</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"Korrasami's canon. That's
                 what it is." So, a lot of people were super excited about that, especially since,
                 up to that point, there really hadn't been
                 a whole lot of huge representation for female ships.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I guess you can say it was a
                 nudge to move from passive consumption to active consumption.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So it was just discovering a collection of books in my
                 own home from my aunt and my mother and so on, their teachers. And my aunt in particular,
                 she
                 teaches English, and so they had old texts that I found and started reading
                 them. And that's when I began to realize that the books that I had been reading
                 were excluding me. It was something that you sort of knew but you didn't quite
                 know. I guess it comes back to not knowing what you're missing
                 until you finally have it. So when I first read texts were people
                 were actually talking about foods that I would eat or where people were living
                 in communities like mine, where people spoke that way that I spoke, et
                 cetera.
                 Because even though I speak, let's say,
                 like this, how I speak with my family or how I speak with my friends from back
                 home, it's a little different even though ... So, my particular country, we
                 speak English, but it's a particular kind of English. So just
                 seeing that in text and then realizing that the fantasies and so on that I was
                 consuming were ... I don't know, it had these strange things that just didn't quite
                 compute with where I was living. That's where it really clicked for me. And from
                 that point onward, I think that's where I began to see it in everything else. The
                 biggest shift didn't really come until I moved to the US, because back home I was
                 part of the
                 majority, so even though it's absent, you were still seeing yourself in other
                 ways, whether that's being who was teaching you or who was in the news as a
                 politician, et cetera. But here it was a completely different
                 ballgame, so it felt more insidious</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
                 was on Twitter casually scrolling through something, and someone from back home
                 happened to mention how the finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background
                 and
                 the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
                 that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
                 Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
                 I
                 could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
                 been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
                 how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I think it
                 just came back to capturing that, the imagery of it, the tone of the chapter, the
                 voice of it because, at least to me, it works really hard to put us in Asami's shoes
                 and make us experience it exactly as she's experiencing it.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It was sort of ... To me,
                 it was groundbreaking in how they handled that because we get to see Korra, who is
                 this all-powerful person, come to grips with what she might be like after having
                 this really terrible thing happen to her and want sort of responsibilities she once
                 had, and how it's still there, but she has all these other things she now has to
                 deal with as well, like her mental health and her physical recovery and so
                 forth.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> It has less to do with fandom
                 itself and more to do with the external world. And even now it's, I guess it's ...
                 I
                 don't know. I think it
                 just seemed like the safer option at the time.  But the more
                 time I've spent in that part of fandom, the less I guess I've cared about how it's
                 read or whatever it is. But at the time, it just seemed wiser, particularly if I was
                 having others who may not ... Because fan works and original work for me are on the
                 same level, and so I'm not concerned, I guess, with people reading it for ... people
                 reading it and not seeing a difference in quality, but rather how they experience
                 the content. And so I think I was still considering who the audience would
                 be.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>The universe raises really
                 interesting conversations about inequality and power and change and so forth, but
                 we
                 kind of always see it from the position of the privileged. And I think that's my favorite
                 thing about fandom
                 and fan fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that
                 either there wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important
                 enough to explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always
                 in the forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the
                 world," not just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
                 through.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I think I'd actually forgotten about this until
                 someone else had written it in their own fanfiction, which is part of what's so fun
                 about reading fanfiction. There are all these ideas that you don't quite pickup on
                 right away, but someone else mentions it, and it clicks, and you start to rotate the
                 world and look at it from a different angle.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Because there is this thing in fanfiction where we
                 assume that all people who are accessing it are familiar with the text. And while
                 that is often common when we want it to function beyond that world to have relevance
                 in other ways, I think for me personally it's important to integrate more parts of
                 the world, of the universe.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think,
                 and I'll probably go with my own fandom experiences, it just comes back to how
                 the world is constructed externally. So just even the idea of imagining inside
                 of what was placed before us, it takes a special kind of familiarity with the
                 boarders of the world to imagine a world that is different from what is
                 presented to you. At the time, I don't know, it was just that Korra
                 and Mako were what was the norm. And so I think it made sense for some people to
                 only be able to see that happening. I mean, I didn't see the possibility of
                 Korrasami until the very end. But when I circled back around
                 after having spent about several months reading several fanfictions</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But yeah, I just, spending so much time reading so much fanfiction
                 from LOK and then branching out into Steven Universe and moving
                 from Steven Universe into Supergirl, there was
                 just more of an interaction with another side of fandom, the slash side of
                 fandom. I don't know. I think you have to be integrated with others who are
                 looking for more than what's presented, looking for more than what's norm,
                 what's the acceptable way of telling a story of any kind of relationship really.
                 Because even when
                 you talk about what characters are bound to get more attention and more
                 interesting and so on and so forth, when you look at fandom in general you'll
                 find that when those characters are black or just generally a person of color in
                 comparison to a character being white, that people are least particular when the
                 fandom's dominated by white faces and so forth. They are more likely to explore
                 those characters and to humanize them and to want to get to know them better,
                 while other characters and what their hopes and dreams and ideas might be for
                 the world are pushed to the side.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I don't know. I'm not surprised. Plus the allocishets tend to dominate
                 fandom in general, so it made sense that they would sort of own the sandbox and
                 everyone else should be playing to the side.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Actually, I think it may have come back to that as well, a combination of both
                 familiarity with visual cues in storytelling, both a tendency to read closer in text
                 in general, whether it's literature or visual media, as well as having familiarized
                 yourself with another community. I'm always on the fence sometimes when I'm talking
                 about how people are seeing or not seeing certain things. Because even with my
                 current fandom, it's like half the people are saying that we're delusional or
                 creating things where there aren't things. And then other times you see these
                 exact phenomena occurring in cishet media.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And
                 you could tell, from a fandom perspective, some people who are cishet won't be able
                 to speak to
                 this, but you could tell that the writer's room was split in
                 how they were portraying the characters because I think they got uncomfortable with
                 how fandom
                 was growing so rapidly and intensely around these two
                 characters, even
                 to the point where they used the black character as a wedge between
                 them. So, just so many layers of so many awful things happening
                 in that show. </li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I'm non-binary, so a lot of my work as I got older started
                 to deal more with gender as well as sexuality, also being
                 bi-sexual. I used it sort of as a tool in some fanfics to work
                 through ideas or feelings that I'd had and didn't know how to properly verbalize
                 yet. I was putting them on paper, using another
                 character as the medium and expressing or exploring different ideas in an area
                 where I felt I was kind of safe to do so. I didn't always
                 publish all of them, but the one that you contacted me over, I did,
                 obviously.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Mainly regarding the pairings that would
                 show up, it would be mainly non-hetero pairings if that makes more sense than
                 just saying a pairing because there would be some exploring of gender and what
                 not with some characters. Or I would definitely be focusing on male-male or
                 female-female relationships as well, because a lot of the media already does a lot
                 of
                 the male-female exploration. And a lot of the purpose of fandom
                 is to sort of explore beyond what we're just given.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
                 Jaime and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
                 because obviously they wouldn't be having as
                 much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
                 considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
                 day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
                 from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
                 versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
                 wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
                 identity. But there would definitely be some push
                 back, but how would that change based on the setting?
                 I made her a little bit more comfortable in
                 her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
                 shoulder for Jaime
                 who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
                 well.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to actually put some Game
                 of Thrones content on those tags to begin with because back when I was writing it,
                 there wasn't a lot really going for it. LGBT fanfics, yeah sure, but
                 gender fluid and gender
                 related things, it wasn't really there.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think I would want to go
                 more into maybe tagging some of the triggers maybe now a days because back then
                 there wasn't as much of a discussion around it. Now a days, you have more of a
                 discussion around what bigger tags to put in to help people avoid it for instance.
                 Now that AO3 has updated its tagging system to include and exclude.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>There's a lot of, again, fanfic already out there of
                 them being intimate, but it was all
                 very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
                 vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
                 I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
                 own instead.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I
                 guess I was thinking about also how I had reacted or how my friends had reacted
                 to when I came out to them.
                 I wanted to, I guess write a do-over for some
                 of them about how I would have liked to have that experience with me, like
                 having them knock again and come inside and ask questions and not just kind of
                 leave it right there and not talk again. I wanted to sort of console myself a
                 little bit through it as well as wanted to console Jaime</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I had some really bad, some
                 really heated discussions with a friend on my dashboard on Twitter. We just did that,
                 like Brienne was actually fully a lesbian
                 and that she hated people linking her with Jaime. And I'm like, "That's an
                 interesting concept, not canon, but concept." She was fighting people on the
                 dashboard about it with the sort of bigger, than someone who has like facts in
                 front of them would argue. And I'm like, "I understand, but this is your
                 interpretation." People who ship her with Jaime don't hate lesbians. Please, do
                 not try and put this away. Yeah, it was a whole mess. People
                 came out in droves, angry for different reasons.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And someone wrote a really detailed review, just about
                 how, I remember they said they could taste the road dust from my writing. And I was
                 like, wow. I never thought of it that way. That's really cool. That kind of inspired
                 me to write more, that I could get that emotion out of somebody. They felt like they
                 were actually there with them.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
                 Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
                 Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
                 no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
                 brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
                 thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
                 wrote a Game of Thrones fanfiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
                 series, the first one.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
                 know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Doctor Who episodes is Turn Left.
                 And
                 it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
                 What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
                 And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
                 and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
                 the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
                 that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
                 world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
                 would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
                 maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
                 how I got into that.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I literally got up off the couch and walked away when
                 she got beheaded. I was very upset. It pissed me
                 off that you have a character like Missandei who is very strong, who survives
                 slavery, got out of her chains, became this person who was herself, and then how
                 did she die? She dies in chains, basically in a pissing contest between two
                 white women. That was very, very frustrating and irritating to
                 me.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yes. [Missandei's] a weird character. Mostly she seems to almost
                 be absent from things. She's window dressing. She's there, she doesn't speak, or she
                 speaks, it's one or two sentences in the entire fic. And it's frustrating because
                 once again in the book, she's such a pivotal character.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
                 delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
                 Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
                 away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
                 one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
                 fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
                 of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
                 if I was a former slave. The one thing I
                 would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
                 in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
                 into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
                 anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
                 like to see a bit more of that in Game of Thrones fanfiction. She's really an
                 underused character.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
                 thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
                 in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
                 and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
                 unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
                 me
                 try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
                 There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
                 improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
                 agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
                 dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
                 that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
                 Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
                 we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
                 that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
                 her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
                 supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
                 that.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And like she says in the fic even
                 if I get bit by a lizard-lion or I starve, that's my choice. But it won't be going
                 back
                 to a ruined Winterfell to marry a legitimized bastard.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Sansa is really presented as one of those girls with her
                 head in the clouds. She's definitely not a Margaery Tyrell. She was definitely never
                 really prepared for court
                 life. She has a view of it that is heavily skewed by stories of
                 [inaudible 00:33:28] of these wonderful knights in their shining armor, these
                 lovely ladies who are just ethereal in their beauty, everything being wrapped up
                 in a bow, happily ever after. Maybe something happens, but someone's always
                 rescued. And through the series, that kind of gets torn away
                 from her bit by bit. The Prince Charming that she thought was a Prince Charming is
                 definitely not. There's no one comes to save her. Her brother's more interested in
                 being a king than coming to rescue her from the tower, and the monsters inside it.
                 So really, Sansa's really forced to grow up,
                 and she's really forced to see all these stories as exactly what they are.
                 They're just stories. They're empty stories to make children
                 happy. So when she's thinking back on this, she's thinking more of the scarier
                 stories that maybe she didn't want to listen to.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>These were all things she's done because she believes in
                 Daenerys' vision, she believes in a world
                 without slavery. And after having been a slave and experienced freedom, that's
                 something she'd want for everybody. I hate to say it, Harriet Tubman, how many
                 times did she go back and she got slaves and ran them back out? Simply because
                 I'm free, no one should be in bondage, even if it's a personal risk to myself,
                 to my life, that is a risk I will take, because everyone should be free. And I
                 think as a former slave, Missandei really would have that
                 sentiment.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
                 seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
                 woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
                 anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
                 back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
                 Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
                 slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
                 she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
                 jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
                 great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
                 I've seen it before.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But
                 there are just people who are just nasty. In all the fandoms I've been in, it
                 thankfully hasn't happened to me yet, and I've actually had people defend me in
                 comments. They're just like, "Get that shit out of here." I'm like, "Okay, thank you
                 for being nice." But it seems the Game of Thrones fandoms can get real violent. They
                 get real virulent with their hatred in the comments section. I can't muster that
                 kind of hatred. If I don't like something, I just click off of it. I don't get the
                 hate.</li>

         <h3>Quotes</h3>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't want to be like, "Ah, but I'm writing the version of this character that's
               a woman." I hate that. I know that that's permissible with the meta text but I don't
               want to be part of that.</li>
            <li><strong>Aria: </strong>mostly I felt like I wound up just getting in like an extension of me arguing on the
               internet, which is not a super-healthy way of engaging with communities.</li>
            <li><strong>Aria: </strong>People write political theory when they write fanfic, like a lot of fanfic is political
               theory, a lot of fanfiction is political.</li>
            <li><strong>Aria: </strong>People are like, "Oh..." When people talk about RWBY, the way they talk about the
               White Fang is the way they talk about radical politics. And I don't know if they realize
               it, but I always get really annoyed, because this is like bad political theory. It's
               very normal American political theory, but it's also bad. It's very much like, "Oh,
               there's no justification for violence," it's like, "I don't agree."</li>
            <li><strong>Aria: </strong>When I'm writing this fic it means something, because I'm like... There's a study
               I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about things you don't
               convince them, but if you tell stories you can. And I think that I'm in that place,
               arguing about politics in the fiction space of the internet.</li>
            <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And then I wrote a piece called [inaudible 00:05:42], which was sort of like a revisiting
               of what does... I guess it was actually about immigration, it's just I never really
               ever got around to doing a piece about immigration system, but somebody had a bad
               take about immigration in America in a piece of fanfic and I was like, "God, that's
               a really bad understanding of that friend. That is utopian and wrong."</li>
            <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And that creates fanon, which means you get this whole long space of people being
               like, "Oh yeah, I am writing about this content of fanon in this alternate universe,
               I'm going to write a piece about a radio show</li>
            <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It sort of leaves a lot of space for the development of [inaudible 00:47:39], some
               of the Equalist Asami stuff, and some of the discussion that comes out of that. So
               I think that's very, very fertile ground for fanfic, and I think that it's liberating
               for a lot of folks. So it drives a lot of views.</li>
            <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Just real quick, I'm really interested in the fact that Korra and Mako becomes more
               common after Korrasami happened. That, to me, is just fascinating.</li>
            <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also, if you're looking at a subtext, my people they were like, "Oh yeah, I want to
               tell this story, I want to finish this story." And there's a degree to which it a
               queer reading, there's this political tendency to look at fiction and say, "I am going
               to tell the story you didn't." And so during the subtext period, you've already got
               these people who are basically being like, "Yo, I'm going to tell this story.</li>
            <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
               love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
               stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
               of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
               of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
               "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
               who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
               of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
            <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And I don't know, I don't know if I'd use the fluff and angst tags anymore, just because
               I don't talk about my literature in those terms as much anymore, as I used to, but...
               Largely because nobody...You don't use those tags as much anymore in my view, like
               we don't talk about... Those are very much Fanfiction.net-y terms that pulled over,
               I don't see them as I used to.</li>
            <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think that people writing about suffering and happiness, a lot of things happen
               in love stories in general, particularly in WlW and MlM stuff. Well, I don't know
               if MlM, I don't read it very much just because one, I am not a man, and two, so much
               MlM stuff is kind of uncomfortable? A lot it's very clearly written by women.</li>
            <li><strong>Aria: </strong> a [inaudible 00:57:08] of the audience that come later are less interested in acknowledging
               or talking about race. Given this is a proportion, I don't know if [inaudible 00:57:24]
               but more people as a fandom and those few people aren't interested in talking about
               race in ways that people who had been there before were, and those people who were
               there before continued to talk about race, or if there is an effectively gentrifying
               mmoment that a white fandom comes in, pushes out a fandom of color. I don't know how
               this tag is used, so I would feel hesitant to say something definite. But I find that
               a little bit troublesome.</li>
            <li><strong>Aria: </strong>because it looks to me here that what you're seeing is a movement from seeing the
               word girlfriend in a context of a text that's about a set of texts about relationships
               in a more heterosexual perspective, in a story about women. Because it looks to me
               that this is a story that, if you see jealous there, that looks like I'm looking at
               a piece that's from Korra's point of view. But then if I'm looking at boyfriend, I'm
               also thinking about Korra and Mako.</li>
            <li><strong>Aria: </strong>The context is basically just, yeah, things you would expect people would say on a
               date, things you'd expect people to do on a date, things that writers do when they
               run out of words, like chuckle.</li>
            <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also this more mature understanding of a relationship, seeing their partner as a dork
               versus like, seeing them as cute. And obviously you see your partner is cute for a
               long time after you start dating, that... Viewing someone as a dork is a more developed
               sense of what a relationship is.</li>
            <li><strong>Aria: </strong>That's an interesting set of outcomes, just looking at masculinity as almost sexual
               in the middle there, an almost dangerous. Because a person's understanding of masculinity
               are sexual, like the second one is a kind of dangerous, like a kind of danger. Versus
               like the sexuality in the second one, for feminine as well as that same panel, but
               it's not like dangerous... That's very interesting, it's very interesting that the
               middle section feels just more sexual in general. I was laughing at the bottom set
               for heiress in the middle column, "a-asami" there. It's like, I guess? </li>
            <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And to be fair, omega and alpha as being there in the far right column. I don't really
               understand ABO [alpha, beta, omega] as in general, so I can't talk. They're not as
               inherently sexual. They definitely struck me as relatively sexual, and that's not</li>
            <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I had a very close group of friends on Live Journal back
               in the early 2000s. That, I think, probably because I was a teenager. Perhaps this
               is because of all those reasons. But that kind of close-knittedness has never kind
               of shown up for me ever since. I think I tend to participate now on more, "Oh, this
               is really interesting for me. And this is really fascinating." And I'll go into it
               for the material as opposed to the friendships themselves.</li>
            <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And all of this kind of, to me, I mean, I think that's what
               a lot of fanficiton is, at least. It's taking things that are already there and kind
               of pooling them together. And sometimes you have amazing coincidences that people
               just don't think about. And it's about exploiting those coincidences, and making
               them sound like, "Oh, I'm so brilliant. I actually had thought about it
               beforehand."</li>
            <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was really worried about how it
               would be perceived by the fandom, how it would be received by people even outside
               of
               the fandom.</li>
            <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, obviously, race bending is, and can
               be, very racist if not done in a very respectful manner.</li>
            <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And my friends in the fandom were all like, "Okay, well,
               we trust you. Because it's also your
               culture. You know what you're doing, you know where you're coming from. But we
               would not do it." And, I mean, the vast majority of them were from the U.K. or
               the U.S., and they were not from the same culture. And they
               were like, "We would be very hesitant about it, but we trust you. If you know what
               you're doing, then go ahead and do it." But they were very supportive in that
               manner. But it wasn't a blanket support, as I was kind of hoping for, I should
               say.</li>
            <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I wasn't sure people would
               think that it was good enough. Because I was also combining both South Indian and
               North Indian tropes, to a
               certain extent. And those weren't necessarily very compatible. And there's a lot
               of history behind that and everything. And I wasn't entirely
               sure how people would perceive it.</li>
            <li><strong>Dialux: </strong> And I was so
               worried. Because all of this was very close to my heart, and I did not want to have
               to deal with a lot of backlash, or feedback, or having to fight to say, "Well, I
               don't mean to be rude on any of these kinds of things." These are meant with respect
               and they're meant with love. And they're from a part of myself.</li>
            <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the reason I did the Jodhaa Akbar tag was actually
               because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
               other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
               fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
               particular tag.</li>
            <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Oh. I think I learned that people are far more
               understanding than I was giving them credit for, especially because I was so afraid
               about the reception.</li>
            <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I could
               see how much the fandom had increased in size by the time Season Seven had came
               around. Because it was huge. There were a lot of people there, it had increased
               exponentially. And Season Eight made the fandom even bigger, honestly, in a certain
               way. But I also remember that there were a lot of fandom issues going on at the
               time, between people within the fandom and everything.</li>
            <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But, second of all, the fandom itself,
               I think, had grown to such a point that it kind of imploded. I do remember that a
               lot of good authors, and a lot of people did leave the fandom at the time.
               </li>
            <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, first of all, the fandom was
               terrible.</li>
            <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>You can tell
               exactly what the fandom is focused on here.</li>
            <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I was actually
               looking at the most common gender pairings. It's very interesting to me, because I
               think if you look at any other major
               fandom, you would probably get male male slash at a much higher rate than you're
               getting here.
               And it's just very interesting to me to
               see how female male has been so prevalent across all seasons. And to such an
               extent. And, I mean, obviously, there are a lot of theories about why that
               is, and how that comes about, and all of that. But I think...
               Oh, wow. Wait. Hang on. I'm looking... There's Gen that's higher than male slash in
               Season Eight.</li>
            <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
               I obviously can't give an explanation for a lot of these. But I think that they
               make sense, to a certain extent, because there definitely are a lot more
               heterosexual relationships within this fandom than I've seen in a lot of other
               fandoms. And I think that's probably because we don't have one
               main character and one side character that's like the sidekick to the main
               character, both of them being male. You don't have that here.</li>
            <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I actually do remember how unhappy people were that Sansa didn't
               end with a love interest at the end of Season Eight.</li>
            <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I could understand why people felt unhappy about it. But at the same time, I
               think you're beating on the wrong bush here. There's a lot of other problems to deal
               with within this fandom. And within this canon that we don't particularly need as
               much as you're putting into it.</li>
            <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Tyrion is
               surprisingly popular to be honest. I didn't think that he'd be as... I knew he'd be
               popular as a character. But not a person on Archive of Our Own. I didn't think that
               AO3 people would write a lot about him.</li>
            <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>so it was, when I think I started it, Korrasami hadn't
               been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
               And maybe, I think,
               during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
               different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
               strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
            <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And sometimes, there were just
               prompts that were not necessarily things that I wanted to do or actively didn't want
               to do</li>
            <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> I
               know it's, I don't want to say a popular trope, but it's a common trope in a lot of
               fanfiction communities, is the student-teacher
               ... What is that? Student-teacher pairing, whatever. My dad is a teacher, so the
               idea of that has always just absolutely not been something that I want to
               encourage, and it just isn't good, so I don't like writing that, I don't like
               reading it. That's definitely one of the things. I'm sure
               there's been others, but that's always been a big one for me.</li>
            <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I know a lot of people like to have full sentences, and
               get really detailed and say things like that, but I always find that to be sort of
               distracting, because I know, when I'm personally looking for something, I like to
               be
               able to just click through until I find exactly what I'm looking for. So, if
               somebody has what I'm looking for, but also in that same tag is a full sentence of
               something else, it doesn't necessarily help me stuff. If somebody's specifically
               looking for, I guess a long-distance relationship thing, they can just click on that
               and see, "Okay, well, it's in here somewhere. I'll just find whichever prompt it
               is." I'm a big fan of just keeping things neat and simple.</li>
            <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And then, just
               seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
               once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
               not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
               the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
               there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
               </li>
            <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
               it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
               since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
               until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
               a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
               decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
               this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
               case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
               Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
               bit.</li>
            <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And even though the trans experience is not necessarily one
               that I know for certain, there's plenty of people in the Korra community, in
               most online Internet communities, where there's plenty of those people and you
               see what they're going through and you see how their lives are,
               and I try not to speak for situations that I've never lived through, but you can
               draw knowledge from that and say, "Okay, well, without going in depth into feelings
               or things like that, I can add this, this, and this, and make it maybe relatable in
               that regard."</li>
            <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's also, given the
               audience, this is considered a family show. So, I realized over time that maybe I
               don't have to write that.</li>
            <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
               it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
               press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" Because I just find keeping people as
               slaves is super ... I didn't want to
               contribute to it, and it was just that sort of idea
               [inaudible 00:47:42] maybe are younger and a little bit
               more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
               been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
               thing.</li>
            <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Especially with the prompts and setting boundaries like you
               mentioned earlier. It's writing what you want.</li>
            <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Oh,
               the easy answer is sexism,
               because everyone sees the main heroine next to a cute boy and decides, "That's
               good. I'm going to do that," without maybe necessarily putting much more thought
               into it.</li>
            <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Obviously, there's always going to be people who say,
               "I want a female ship. Going for it. I don't
               care whether or not they necessarily gel." I'm sure there's
               people ... I feel like I went back a million years ago and looked at the first
               Korrasami fics, just out of curiosity, to see when they were published, and I'm sure
               that they were like episode one, because it's just what people do, and it's great.
               Ships are meant to be fun, they're not always meant to be canon.</li>
            <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, it was there, but
               it's not surprising that a lot of people who aren't looking for it don't go and see
               it. A lot of
               straight people I know will look at a lot of these relationships and say, "Oh,
               that came from nowhere."</li>
            <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>At the end of season three, we saw that development and
               we saw, especially during Korra's fight with Zaheer, Asami looked the most scared
               out of everybody, and her reaction to her offer to stay with Korra through her
               recovery, and help any way she can was sort of, "That's a little gayer than it maybe
               should be," that sort of look. So, a lot
               of people took that and decided to go with it, especially since
               the relationship was [inaudible 01:00:21], whether or not ...
               Again, and at that time, we didn't know the writer's intention, so it was just
               everybody, or at least Korrasami fans, picking
               up on it and saying, "Okay, well, we don't know when season four is happening,
               so we're just going to kick off from there and this is what could
               happen."</li>
            <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Tahno was just a bully that people decide ... I don't
               understand why people like that, but people do.</li>
            <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> immediately after
               the season finale aired, everyone was sort of unsure like, "This is canon, right?
               This is canon. That's what this looks
               like,"</li>
            <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"Korrasami's canon. That's
               what it is." So, a lot of people were super excited about that, especially since,
               up to that point, there really hadn't been
               a whole lot of huge representation for female ships.</li>
            <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, to
               see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
               god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
               have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
            <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I got into forums and fans would
               translate for those of us who didn't speak Hindi. And obviously
               people would answer questions if you asked because you couldn't get everything in
               the translations or the summaries. And during that time, we would talk about the
               plot of the show, what the characters were doing, where we were expecting things to
               go at that time. It was just a lot of the basic things at fandom.</li>
            <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>To
               realizing that there was a community of people who were also interested in
               discussing how these shows and books and games et cetera were failing us, whether
               it
               was in terms of the content or the representation or just releasing new things like
               thought arcs that weren't followed through on.</li>
            <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I am currently in the Supergirl fandom, which has been a mess.
               I'm saying that nicely.</li>
            <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But also the fics I had read after the
               show had finished seemed to focus primarily on how Korra was dealing with ...
               Obviously, it was a really traumatic experience and so on in how she ... what had
               happened in the gap years that they hadn't shown us for Korra.</li>
            <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It's just to be someone who builds and creates
               with the purpose of fixing or making better, but then not being able to do so for
               someone within your personal life. But the imagery also for that chapter was, I guess,
               built in subtext because I wasn't
               quite sure yet how to engage with what was happening in ways that were visible
               to other people outside of the fan community, the slashfan
               community.</li>
            <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> It has less to do with fandom
               itself and more to do with the external world. And even now it's, I guess it's ...
               I
               don't know. I think it
               just seemed like the safer option at the time.  But the more
               time I've spent in that part of fandom, the less I guess I've cared about how it's
               read or whatever it is. But at the time, it just seemed wiser, particularly if I was
               having others who may not ... Because fan works and original work for me are on the
               same level, and so I'm not concerned, I guess, with people reading it for ... people
               reading it and not seeing a difference in quality, but rather how they experience
               the content. And so I think I was still considering who the audience would
               be.</li>
            <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>The universe raises really
               interesting conversations about inequality and power and change and so forth, but
               we
               kind of always see it from the position of the privileged. And I think that's my favorite
               thing about fandom
               and fan fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that
               either there wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important
               enough to explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always
               in the forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the
               world," not just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
               through.</li>
            <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I think I'd actually forgotten about this until
               someone else had written it in their own fanfiction, which is part of what's so fun
               about reading fanfiction. There are all these ideas that you don't quite pickup on
               right away, but someone else mentions it, and it clicks, and you start to rotate the
               world and look at it from a different angle.</li>
            <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I wasn't part of the fandom itself, so I didn't quite
               get to be part of ... Maybe I should be happy for that because I missed all the fan
               wars.</li>
            <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
               missed the smug satisfaction, but I also missed all the stress and anger, so I'm
               happy for that.</li>
            <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Considering my Supergirl years, I can imagine. And then when you
               [inaudible 00:45:32]
               Korra is an avatar who's a
               woman.
               She's not a dainty fainting
               flower that they love.</li>
            <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
               think for that particular story I had to remind myself, especially because I had
               read so many fan fictions where this was ... And I know it's understandable, but I
               kind find it a flaw for some people. Just keeping the world in focus.</li>
            <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Because there is this thing in fanfiction where we
               assume that all people who are accessing it are familiar with the text. And while
               that is often common when we want it to function beyond that world to have relevance
               in other ways, I think for me personally it's important to integrate more parts of
               the world, of the universe.</li>
            <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think,
               and I'll probably go with my own fandom experiences, it just comes back to how
               the world is constructed externally. So just even the idea of imagining inside
               of what was placed before us, it takes a special kind of familiarity with the
               boarders of the world to imagine a world that is different from what is
               presented to you. At the time, I don't know, it was just that Korra
               and Mako were what was the norm. And so I think it made sense for some people to
               only be able to see that happening. I mean, I didn't see the possibility of
               Korrasami until the very end. But when I circled back around
               after having spent about several months reading several fanfictions</li>
            <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But yeah, I just, spending so much time reading so much fanfiction
               from LOK and then branching out into Steven Universe and moving
               from Steven Universe into Supergirl, there was
               just more of an interaction with another side of fandom, the slash side of
               fandom. I don't know. I think you have to be integrated with others who are
               looking for more than what's presented, looking for more than what's norm,
               what's the acceptable way of telling a story of any kind of relationship really.
               Because even when
               you talk about what characters are bound to get more attention and more
               interesting and so on and so forth, when you look at fandom in general you'll
               find that when those characters are black or just generally a person of color in
               comparison to a character being white, that people are least particular when the
               fandom's dominated by white faces and so forth. They are more likely to explore
               those characters and to humanize them and to want to get to know them better,
               while other characters and what their hopes and dreams and ideas might be for
               the world are pushed to the side.</li>
            <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I don't know. I'm not surprised. Plus the allocishets tend to dominate
               fandom in general, so it made sense that they would sort of own the sandbox and
               everyone else should be playing to the side.</li>
            <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
               mean, people are out there writing Korra Tarrlok fanfic. Okay, but Korrasami just
               seems too weird,
               okay people. I mean, I was also part of it too, that people were so willing to see
               all these other,
               in some ways really twisted, relationship dynamics, but
               couldn't quite bring
               themselves to see what others were seeing when they took the allocishet glasses
               off. I was part of that group as well, until in the end.</li>
            <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>When I saw that I was like, "Okay. This is pretty blatant. I
               don't see how anyone is not seeing this." But I can't judge
               because when you go back and you see the way that Korra and Asami speak to each
               other in the beginning, it's there, but it's not intentional subtext. It's like ...
               I mean, it makes sense that some people didn't see it.</li>
            <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Actually, I think it may have come back to that as well, a combination of both
               familiarity with visual cues in storytelling, both a tendency to read closer in text
               in general, whether it's literature or visual media, as well as having familiarized
               yourself with another community. I'm always on the fence sometimes when I'm talking
               about how people are seeing or not seeing certain things. Because even with my
               current fandom, it's like half the people are saying that we're delusional or
               creating things where there aren't things. And then other times you see these
               exact phenomena occurring in cishet media.</li>
            <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>At
               that time ... When I first came across it, I was like, "They're probably
               overreacting," because I know how fandom can get.</li>
            <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And
               you could tell, from a fandom perspective, some people who are cishet won't be able
               to speak to
               this, but you could tell that the writer's room was split in
               how they were portraying the characters because I think they got uncomfortable with
               how fandom
               was growing so rapidly and intensely around these two
               characters, even
               to the point where they used the black character as a wedge between
               them. So, just so many layers of so many awful things happening
               in that show. </li>
            <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I'm non-binary, so a lot of my work as I got older started
               to deal more with gender as well as sexuality, also being
               bi-sexual. I used it sort of as a tool in some fanfics to work
               through ideas or feelings that I'd had and didn't know how to properly verbalize
               yet. I was putting them on paper, using another
               character as the medium and expressing or exploring different ideas in an area
               where I felt I was kind of safe to do so. I didn't always
               publish all of them, but the one that you contacted me over, I did,
               obviously.</li>
            <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Mainly regarding the pairings that would
               show up, it would be mainly non-hetero pairings if that makes more sense than
               just saying a pairing because there would be some exploring of gender and what
               not with some characters. Or I would definitely be focusing on male-male or
               female-female relationships as well, because a lot of the media already does a lot
               of
               the male-female exploration. And a lot of the purpose of fandom
               is to sort of explore beyond what we're just given.</li>
            <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, definitely when it comes to trying to write it
               realistically as well, but the banter back and forth was very difficult. I read a
               lot of fanfic where it can be very stalkish and when I think about it and I think
               about someone saying it out loud, I just like cringe. My face caves in.</li>
            <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to actually put some Game
               of Thrones content on those tags to begin with because back when I was writing it,
               there wasn't a lot really going for it. LGBT fanfics, yeah sure, but
               gender fluid and gender
               related things, it wasn't really there.</li>
            <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I feel for them, a lot of their fics also had a lot of like Jaime
               being the man and Brienne finally being able to let her guard
               down.</li>
            <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Like, where is this content that
               should be out there because it's in the books and why is no one taking this up and
               writing about it?</li>
            <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think I would want to go
               more into maybe tagging some of the triggers maybe now a days because back then
               there wasn't as much of a discussion around it. Now a days, you have more of a
               discussion around what bigger tags to put in to help people avoid it for instance.
               Now that AO3 has updated its tagging system to include and exclude.</li>
            <li><strong>Valk: </strong>There's a lot of, again, fanfic already out there of
               them being intimate, but it was all
               very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
               vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
               I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
               own instead.</li>
            <li><strong>Valk: </strong>And then it just kind of gets more
               depressing as it goes on. For some reason, John and Sansa's the most popular ship.
               It's like, I understand that they're not technically related, but I don't get it
               because in the book, they had this very tense relationship and in the show I know
               that they were more around each other.</li>
            <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Peytr/Sansa, I want to have some words with people.</li>
            <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I ship Sansa and Marjory and I tried to write fic for
               them, but I
               don't know why it never picked up. Marjory just walked around the whole show
               just hitting on everyone. I was like why isn't there more of this? It's
               literally right here.</li>
            <li><strong>Valk: </strong>
               Renly/Lauris,
               obviously.</li>
            <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Sandor and Sansa, I will say that I like their ship name
               as San-San. I do understand the whole
               like rough, the woman that warms his heart thing. Again, it's all very like
               romance novel-y prompts when I've tried to find fic and I'm just like, "I'll
               just write a Nora Roberts novel." I'd so read her books if I
               wanted to. I don't need to read them here.</li>
            <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Most Game of Thrones fanfic is incredibly hetero
               normative and it's a lot of university AU, high school AU and
               I'm like, "What about literally anything else?" I did a modern universe
               [inaudible 00:37:49] Please, literally anything
               else.</li>
            <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Again, it's Renly/Lauris,
               Sansa/Marjory. Yeah, there's not a lot really on there.</li>
            <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was just a lot of Nora Roberts style in AO3 for
               sure. A lot of incest. An exorbitant amount of
               incest, like beyond what I even take it. I'm typically very do what you want,
               but even now, I'm just like don't like that.</li>
            <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, it's depressingly small. I know that when I was writing it, there was a lot
               less fanfic, but you would think even with Jaime and Brienne having that very
               unique friendship/relationship</li>
            <li><strong>Valk: </strong>a lot of
               the fics, even with Jaime and Brienne is just depressingly, like, "Wow, if I
               wanted to read this fic, I'd just go to like any romance section and find
               it."</li>
            <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I would almost want to just write fic out of
               spite.</li>
            <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I had some really bad, some
               really heated discussions with a friend on my dashboard on Twitter. We just did that,
               like Brienne was actually fully a lesbian
               and that she hated people linking her with Jaime. And I'm like, "That's an
               interesting concept, not canon, but concept." She was fighting people on the
               dashboard about it with the sort of bigger, than someone who has like facts in
               front of them would argue. And I'm like, "I understand, but this is your
               interpretation." People who ship her with Jaime don't hate lesbians. Please, do
               not try and put this away. Yeah, it was a whole mess. People
               came out in droves, angry for different reasons.</li>
            <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because one thing as a writer that will pull me completely out of a story is if
               there is a colloquialism that should not belong. Or if
               you're using words, and I'm like, okay, I've never heard that word used on the show,
               so now you've just dropped a bomb in the middle of a wedding cake, and there's cake
               everywhere. It just pulls me out.</li>
            <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yes. [Missandei's] a weird character. Mostly she seems to almost
               be absent from things. She's window dressing. She's there, she doesn't speak, or she
               speaks, it's one or two sentences in the entire fic. And it's frustrating because
               once again in the book, she's such a pivotal character.</li>
            <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And so, you get those fics where she
               either has none of those, she's either not there, or she has really none of those
               attributes. She's kind of just a yes person. Yes, Khaleesi, no Khaleesi, yes my
               queen.</li>
            <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
               delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
               Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
               away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
               one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
               fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
               of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
               if I was a former slave. The one thing I
               would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
               in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
               into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
               anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
               like to see a bit more of that in Game of Thrones fanfiction. She's really an
               underused character.</li>
            <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
               thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
               in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
               and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
               unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
               me
               try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
               There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
               improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful.</li>
            <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>The
               "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
               People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
               right there." So I had the "What if."</li>
            <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Out of character? I
               never know. I think my
               characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
               "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
               it may be out of character."</li>
            <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Alternate universe, canon
               divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
               want to get blasted on that one.</li>
            <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I've learned a lot about people actually in the fandom.
               Game of Thrones has a very active fandom. I wasn't prepared for that when I joined.
               You get people who, there are the butts, there are the trolls. Trolls are going to
               troll though, so I just kind of push them to the side.</li>
            <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But there are people who
               they're really willing to engage with you, and they have questions. In a lot of
               other fandoms, some people are just like, "This is a nice story." Game of Thrones
               fans will have questions for you in the comments. They'll be like, "What about this?
               And what about this? Oh, what about this? What do you think about this?" It's fun
               to
               get that dialog. That's something I never had before.</li>
            <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But
               there are just people who are just nasty. In all the fandoms I've been in, it
               thankfully hasn't happened to me yet, and I've actually had people defend me in
               comments. They're just like, "Get that shit out of here." I'm like, "Okay, thank you
               for being nice." But it seems the Game of Thrones fandoms can get real violent. They
               get real virulent with their hatred in the comments section. I can't muster that
               kind of hatred. If I don't like something, I just click off of it. I don't get the
               hate.</li>
            <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But I can
               see, especially in Season Five, and Six, and Seven, where you see Jon Snow, Sansa
               Stark, because these two characters kind of get back together in the show. When
               they're together, you can see their dynamic in everything else. And they look good
               together. That's always a good thing. It's always big when it comes to shipping, who
               looks good with who.</li>
            <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But I think people really enjoy the Jaime Lannister, Brienne of
               Tarth is kind of like the person, your frenemy. The person you love to hate.
               I would rescue you if you're falling off a cliff, but I'd probably punch you in the
               stomach when I got you back on solid land for being in that position to begin
               with.</li>
            <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Sansa, Petyr, I've always hated that one, simply because he's grooming. It's
               very obvious. Where I can see Sansa starting to like Sandor
               because he would rebuff her at every turn if she started to show interest in him,
               even though he didn't want to. He'd just be like, "I can't deal with this. I can't
               deal with you." Petyr would relish that. He
               does everything he can to get her into trusting him, and thinking of him as her
               friend, and I would do anything for you, and that's really, really creepy. It's
               always a surprise to me when I see Petyr Baelish, Sansa Stark fics especially
               ones where it's not manipulative, and coercive, and creepy, I'm like, "What are
               you guys seeing in that?" That's just odd.</li>
            <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I like the modern setting. Modern setting seems to be the most
               common one.</li>
            <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think it's the same with, I'm also very
               active in the Star Wars fandom, and that's one thing you see in a lot of Star Wars,
               especially the new trilogy. People love taking the characters out of where they are
               and
               putting them in today. That doesn't surprise me at all.</li>
            <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>canon divergence, angst, love, romance, smut. Not really. Everything seems to be kind
               of
               right where it should be, based on what I've seen. I'm trying to think of a tag that
               may
               be missing. No. Fluff, yeah, fluff's there, angst, romance. No, I think everything
               is
               there. You just randomly go on AO3, that's what you'd see.</li>

Uptakes are the ways in which a writer responds to one genre by engaging in another genre, following particular conventions or expectations for how to engage with the second genre. In terms of fan uptakes, these may be fanfics or fan art that respond to the original source material but follow genre expectations in the fan community. These codes include critical uptakes, canon-complicit uptakes, canon-resistant uptakes, and more.</p>

            <h3>Quotes</h3>
            <ul>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>People are like, "Oh..." When people talk about RWBY, the way they talk about the
                  White Fang is the way they talk about radical politics. And I don't know if they realize
                  it, but I always get really annoyed, because this is like bad political theory. It's
                  very normal American political theory, but it's also bad. It's very much like, "Oh,
                  there's no justification for violence," it's like, "I don't agree."</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>When I'm writing this fic it means something, because I'm like... There's a study
                  I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about things you don't
                  convince them, but if you tell stories you can. And I think that I'm in that place,
                  arguing about politics in the fiction space of the internet.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And then I wrote a piece called [inaudible 00:05:42], which was sort of like a revisiting
                  of what does... I guess it was actually about immigration, it's just I never really
                  ever got around to doing a piece about immigration system, but somebody had a bad
                  take about immigration in America in a piece of fanfic and I was like, "God, that's
                  a really bad understanding of that friend. That is utopian and wrong."</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
                  context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
                  very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
                  you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
                  original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
                  through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
                  and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
                  with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
                  get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
                  you.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was coming into my own politically, I was becoming my own political individual in
                  a way I hadn't been before. Like I had politics, but this is around the time that
                  I'm really radicalized, and just me engaging with those contexts.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong> There are things I don't like about it, but I like it as a little bit of text. It's
                  there in the text, it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love
                  feeling represented." So I wrote that.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
                  a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
                  different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
                  in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
                  and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
                  looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I was just engaging with the text's portrayal of trauma.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I was under the impression, reading or engaging with this text, I came away with
                  this feeling like the Northern Water Tribe is somewhat... very different from the
                  rest of the world, and there are ways that it plays as... I don't know if it was textual
                  or sort of fan-driven more, but I remember coming away with this feeling that there
                  is a marginalized subjectivity in the Northern Water Tribe. And so telling this story
                  about difference in culture, and we'll get to... I'll get to Korra's upbringing a
                  little bit later, because you're going to ask about 10 minutes later about Korra's
                  upbringing. But I want to... Basically that I think Korra's upbringing is particularly
                  reflective of that culture, yeah.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I come away from Korra feeling like, "This is a gender thing going on." I don't buy
                  that there's not homophobia in a world with gender in the like weird way that... In
                  ways that still reflect our I think gender and homophobia [inaudible 00:21:13], the
                  way that we have a sense of gender. Big, capital G Gender. And so I thought like,
                  "What does it mean to have culture in the context of... What does it mean to be a
                  cosmopolitan city where... There's both a degree of marginalization for like the Northern
                  Water Tribe closing... Not so much that rules that are really intended to enforce
                  gender norms are going to be there. And also to be like, "Yeah, there's probably a
                  different understanding of gender in context," yeah.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Asami probably can't like cook...because I think it's either canonical or in fanon,
                  and I kind of like that, because I like the notion that... I like the notion that
                  someone who's very good at some things, but just not good at other things.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think that this is a piece that comes from a weird part of what I understood about
                  that world. To me, Korra grows up in a compound with people who are older than her,
                  who aren't likely to tell her the truth about things. Because the White Lotus is an
                  organization of people who are fundamentally keeping her apart. And I remember being
                  like, "Oh, these folks are not going to tell a child about queer sexuality." Particularly
                  sexuality is a hard topic, you grow up in that kind of compound in a world where queer
                  identities are looked down on, you're going to come away with this very strange view
                  about that. And you might just be told nothing.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Because I imagine Korra's pain is seeing the cost of her new trauma after time, because
                  her being injured, being in a place where you are tortured to death as a vulnerability.
                  Every time you experience that pain, I imagine that that's a place that engagement
                  is a struggle after time when you're in that pain. So it's an ordeal for Korra to
                  dress herself.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Whereas Korra grows up in this institution, Asami grows up with a relatively politically
                  progressive father. He's an abuser, but he's also a very, very politically progressive
                  man. He's a radical, he tries to overthrow his government, make the world a more equitable
                  and fair place. It's self-interested, he's a bourgeois radical, but I wouldn't have
                  said that at the time. I imagine Asami as having a relatively normal, relatively healthy
                  understanding of the world in a way, having felt like she, not just knowing that a
                  woman can love another woman, because I guess almost every person in this world knows.
                  This is nothing like, Korra is particularly going to have a hard time because of that
                  institution itself.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>In the context of this piece, a lot of my understanding of Hiroshi as a bourgeois
                  radical is that I'm not going to have a [inaudible 00:30:36], because I don't really
                  have a sense of class politics at the time, or have the beginnings of that study.
                  That's only beginning to be born</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So to me, Hiroshi's both a man that would destroy his children for the things he believes,
                  and in some sense for his own power. But also a man who genuinely is providing aid
                  and comfort and resources for fighting for what he views as liberation, and that liberation's
                  probably genuine at some level. I think it's fair to say that there is a political
                  bender-like supremacy at the beginning. I mean there is, we know there's a bender
                  supremacy at the beginning of The Legend of Korra. And so that's how I understand
                  Hiroshi.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wanted to give a sense of what is the politics of the Northern Water Tribe? And
                  I kind of wanted to say that queerness isn't criminalized in the Northern Water Tribe,
                  or is not criminalized anymore. Also I wanted to say this is a different relationship.
                  But the other thing I wanted to talk about is, what are politicians willing to give
                  up for their family, and what are they not?</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Because I know what our reactionary politics is like, I think I'd start around the
                  time that Kuvira is beginning to gain power. I'd write it as a story that talks about
                  immigration, and talks about sweeping panic and fear that spill off of that. I'd probably
                  talk about gender through those lenses, and I'd probably talk about humanity in a
                  slightly more complex... I'd probably make it a story that... I'd probably both use
                  modern messages to say that, I'd probably talk more about police state, and police
                  state as endless spying networks where you don't know when you're being spied on and
                  when you're not, and endless police states</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
                  a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
                  but it's good.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also I think it's when fiction ends, it does draw people who are like, "Oh, I want
                  to write more on this subject, I want to play with these concepts again." There's
                  also a distinct un-ended-ness</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think the redo of the relationship, the exploration is limited, is kind of bad.
                  But I also think that the way that we end somewhere where it's like, they just want
                  to be married, or at the end of their first date, we did see them agree, yeah I want
                  to do this. Yeah, I want to have this, or I like this, it's healthy. I love that!
                  I just see that as a lot of things for writers to engage with.[inaudible 00:47:08]
                  what are other ways we can imagine it?</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And that creates fanon, which means you get this whole long space of people being
                  like, "Oh yeah, I am writing about this content of fanon in this alternate universe,
                  I'm going to write a piece about a radio show</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It sort of leaves a lot of space for the development of [inaudible 00:47:39], some
                  of the Equalist Asami stuff, and some of the discussion that comes out of that. So
                  I think that's very, very fertile ground for fanfic, and I think that it's liberating
                  for a lot of folks. So it drives a lot of views.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also, if you're looking at a subtext, my people they were like, "Oh yeah, I want to
                  tell this story, I want to finish this story." And there's a degree to which it a
                  queer reading, there's this political tendency to look at fiction and say, "I am going
                  to tell the story you didn't." And so during the subtext period, you've already got
                  these people who are basically being like, "Yo, I'm going to tell this story.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
                  love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
                  stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
                  of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
                  of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
                  "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
                  who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
                  of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And I don't know, I don't know if I'd use the fluff and angst tags anymore, just because
                  I don't talk about my literature in those terms as much anymore, as I used to, but...
                  Largely because nobody...You don't use those tags as much anymore in my view, like
                  we don't talk about... Those are very much Fanfiction.net-y terms that pulled over,
                  I don't see them as I used to.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First guess is actually that there's a) an explosion of stories that aren't canon
                  compliant, so people are staying people are saying, "This story is canon compliant,"
                  as a way of engaging. In terms of, it makes sense to say something's canon-compliant
                  sort of at the end of the piece, because once the story is over then it makes sense
                  to go back and say, "actually this is canon compliant." A lot of stories before a
                  story ends it's already like, "How could this go from here?" And so I would imagine
                  that the canon compliance people were like, "Well, I'm telling this story based on
                  what literally happened," instead of all of these other tellings that I'm seeing now.
                  That would be my first guess. My second guess is that people are excited to tell stories
                  that were literally just after the end of The Legend of Korra</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I imagine that it's because... It makes sense to tell a friendship story with characters
                  who are already very close friends, and characters who are becoming close friends.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I mean, canon queer relationship is more common because there is canon queer relationship.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong> a [inaudible 00:57:08] of the audience that come later are less interested in acknowledging
                  or talking about race. Given this is a proportion, I don't know if [inaudible 00:57:24]
                  but more people as a fandom and those few people aren't interested in talking about
                  race in ways that people who had been there before were, and those people who were
                  there before continued to talk about race, or if there is an effectively gentrifying
                  mmoment that a white fandom comes in, pushes out a fandom of color. I don't know how
                  this tag is used, so I would feel hesitant to say something definite. But I find that
                  a little bit troublesome.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>because it looks to me here that what you're seeing is a movement from seeing the
                  word girlfriend in a context of a text that's about a set of texts about relationships
                  in a more heterosexual perspective, in a story about women. Because it looks to me
                  that this is a story that, if you see jealous there, that looks like I'm looking at
                  a piece that's from Korra's point of view. But then if I'm looking at boyfriend, I'm
                  also thinking about Korra and Mako.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>The context is basically just, yeah, things you would expect people would say on a
                  date, things you'd expect people to do on a date, things that writers do when they
                  run out of words, like chuckle.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also this more mature understanding of a relationship, seeing their partner as a dork
                  versus like, seeing them as cute. And obviously you see your partner is cute for a
                  long time after you start dating, that... Viewing someone as a dork is a more developed
                  sense of what a relationship is.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But I've also recently published work in Fleabag, which
                  was one of the fandoms that I had to write for for my Yuletide assignment.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, when I wrote this fanfic it was actually one of
                  the... I had signed up for a fic exchange for this one, as well. It's called the
                  Jonsa Exchange. It was their fifth round. Their theme was, "Inspired by
                  film."</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, the
                  person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
                  universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that used second person point of
                  view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
                  you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
                  of
                  view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
                  what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
                  more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then, of course, you have the Targaryen
                  colors, which are black, which are mourning colors according to the Western
                  culture. And all of it kind of comes together. And, of course,
                  Rajput culture is known for its red, its vibrant, blood red. And obviously, that's
                  a
                  Targaryen color.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I initially wanted to make sure that it was pretty
                  clear to everyone that this was a canon divergence. Where one where Rhaegar has won,
                  Jon is raised a Targaryen.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the reason I did the Jodhaa Akbar tag was actually
                  because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
                  other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
                  fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
                  particular tag.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But within this particular fic, as I said earlier, I
                  really wanted to already have that tension. Especially that religious tension between
                  Jon and
                  Sansa. And have that difference, where both of them and neither of them are
                  willing to compromise on that.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the regional tensions, I think, are already
                  there in the canon.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And, I mean, we don't know if she relies more on
                  her religion because she left her homeland, and came to the North. And just
                  wanted some desperate way, something to rely on that's her family, or that
                  reminded her of home. But to me, at least, I can imagine, especially the actual
                  Jodhaa, going to Akbar's Islamic court. And basically being all alone, and not
                  having very many allies. And finding some sort of a solace in her religion of
                  Hinduism.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>A Jon who would grow up in a Targaryen
                  court would look very different in the Targaryen [inaudible
                  00:53:09] than with a Targaryen father.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the thing is, as much as he looked like Ned on a physical level, Ned is not the
                  Ned that we see in canon. Because he's very much a person who has been basically
                  warring for however Jon has been alive.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, actually, Aishwarya Rai, who plays Jodhaa,
                  does not have brown eyes. She has hazel eyes.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
                  I obviously can't give an explanation for a lot of these. But I think that they
                  make sense, to a certain extent, because there definitely are a lot more
                  heterosexual relationships within this fandom than I've seen in a lot of other
                  fandoms. And I think that's probably because we don't have one
                  main character and one side character that's like the sidekick to the main
                  character, both of them being male. You don't have that here.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because
                  I know that a lot of people had mentioned that it was at the beginning of Season
                  Six. Like, when a couple of trailers came out regarding Sansa meeting up with
                  somebody in the North. It was kind of staging with Ramsay Bolton. That Jon Snow and
                  Sansa Stark fandom kind of really took off. And it was the beginning of Season Six
                  that it really, properly emerged. So, it would be interesting to see if there is a
                  cookie cutter point that you can identify like, this is where the general public
                  kind of suddenly said, "Oh, this is the moment."</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But Sansa, she
                  didn't have any such love interests. I mean, obviously, I was shipping her with Jon
                  and everything. But there was no actual canonical basis for that on any
                  level.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
                  very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
                  queer
                  characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
                  go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
                  their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
                  situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's been
                  a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
                  always great. And I think the name was [inaudible 00:11:19]
                  at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
                  art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
                  it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
                  person's mind."</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>so it was, when I think I started it, Korrasami hadn't
                  been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
                  And maybe, I think,
                  during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
                  different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
                  strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I know a lot of people like to have full sentences, and
                  get really detailed and say things like that, but I always find that to be sort of
                  distracting, because I know, when I'm personally looking for something, I like to
                  be
                  able to just click through until I find exactly what I'm looking for. So, if
                  somebody has what I'm looking for, but also in that same tag is a full sentence of
                  something else, it doesn't necessarily help me stuff. If somebody's specifically
                  looking for, I guess a long-distance relationship thing, they can just click on that
                  and see, "Okay, well, it's in here somewhere. I'll just find whichever prompt it
                  is." I'm a big fan of just keeping things neat and simple.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And then, just
                  seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
                  once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
                  not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
                  the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
                  there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
                  </li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
                  super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
                  of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
                  relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
                  should take five steps back, and let's just
                  focus on these two.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And
                  okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
                  notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
                  figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
                  she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
                  Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes. So, those
                  things stand out immediately.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Even in the modern drabbles, or the
                  other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
                  she can access that.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And for Asami, she's gorgeous. Let's be honest. She's
                  gorgeous. So, you notice that, but also, with the death of her mother at a young
                  age, she's sad and growing up with the rich father,
                  she has certain expectations placed on her and where she's going to go in her
                  life according to that company, so she has to be sort of poised and on her toes
                  all the time.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>They wanted to be friends first, but they were so good together that I wanted to be
                  able to
                  sometimes just say they can be immediate, sometimes.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>The first being that we
                  only get a certain amount of them in canon.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, it's kind of just how I always
                  imagined her parents were just going to always be there for her. And we do see that
                  in season three, where she's immediately going to bat for them and each
                  other.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
                  it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
                  since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
                  until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
                  a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
                  decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
                  this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
                  case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
                  Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
                  bit.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, I just tried to stay true to that, I guess, in some
                  regard, as far as her relationship went.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, for that chapter, I want to say, like everything
                  else in the collection, it was a prompt, but it was something that I didn't want to
                  ham-fist it, because Korra's definitely, she's
                  traumatized. We see that more than once,</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
                  it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
                  press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" Because I just find keeping people as
                  slaves is super ... I didn't want to
                  contribute to it, and it was just that sort of idea
                  [inaudible 00:47:42] maybe are younger and a little bit
                  more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
                  been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
                  thing.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>even
                  though I will always love Korra and Asami, it's not necessarily always easy to write
                  for that, if you're not getting constant updates for it.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>It was
                  partially based on a drawing by [inaudible 00:50:02] that had
                  Korra and Asami sitting under a tree and just looking out over Republic City,</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's a writer, whose name I always mess up. I want to
                  say it's coeurdastronaute. They do a lot of Clarke and Lexa
                  stuff, but she sets the scene super well with like, "Here's the sky. Here's the
                  roads. Here's the this," and I tried to emulate that.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's okay to learn from other writers. Like I said
                  with coeurdastronaute, everything she writes is like, "I'm in
                  love with this. It's great. How can I maybe write something similar to that? What
                  parts can I take from this that I want to emulate?"</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Especially with the prompts and setting boundaries like you
                  mentioned earlier. It's writing what you want.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Obviously, there's always going to be people who say,
                  "I want a female ship. Going for it. I don't
                  care whether or not they necessarily gel." I'm sure there's
                  people ... I feel like I went back a million years ago and looked at the first
                  Korrasami fics, just out of curiosity, to see when they were published, and I'm sure
                  that they were like episode one, because it's just what people do, and it's great.
                  Ships are meant to be fun, they're not always meant to be canon.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>At the end of season three, we saw that development and
                  we saw, especially during Korra's fight with Zaheer, Asami looked the most scared
                  out of everybody, and her reaction to her offer to stay with Korra through her
                  recovery, and help any way she can was sort of, "That's a little gayer than it maybe
                  should be," that sort of look. So, a lot
                  of people took that and decided to go with it, especially since
                  the relationship was [inaudible 01:00:21], whether or not ...
                  Again, and at that time, we didn't know the writer's intention, so it was just
                  everybody, or at least Korrasami fans, picking
                  up on it and saying, "Okay, well, we don't know when season four is happening,
                  so we're just going to kick off from there and this is what could
                  happen."</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
                  was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
                  possible love interests.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"Korrasami's canon. That's
                  what it is." So, a lot of people were super excited about that, especially since,
                  up to that point, there really hadn't been
                  a whole lot of huge representation for female ships.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, to
                  see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
                  god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
                  have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I got into forums and fans would
                  translate for those of us who didn't speak Hindi. And obviously
                  people would answer questions if you asked because you couldn't get everything in
                  the translations or the summaries. And during that time, we would talk about the
                  plot of the show, what the characters were doing, where we were expecting things to
                  go at that time. It was just a lot of the basic things at fandom.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>To
                  realizing that there was a community of people who were also interested in
                  discussing how these shows and books and games et cetera were failing us, whether
                  it
                  was in terms of the content or the representation or just releasing new things like
                  thought arcs that weren't followed through on.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Actually, I completely forgot, there was a
                  period where I would write like a satirical review of what was happening, because
                  I
                  don't do that anymore for anything really. But it was an opportunity to experiment
                  with writing and being critical of source materials and so on.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I guess you can say it was a
                  nudge to move from passive consumption to active consumption.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But also the fics I had read after the
                  show had finished seemed to focus primarily on how Korra was dealing with ...
                  Obviously, it was a really traumatic experience and so on in how she ... what had
                  happened in the gap years that they hadn't shown us for Korra.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I kind of wanted to see that explored in my own way. And with Asami in particular,
                  and this was surprising for me because usually I'm all for the main character. I
                  never really remember to think about the other ... But with Asami, it felt like
                  there was this big gap available to us for exploration.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So I kind of wanted to explore that and see how
                  Asami herself was dealing with it. Because for me I like to see how the characters
                  are responding to what's happening to them rather than having the plot happen to
                  them, and with Asami there was just so much room to do that.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Partly, I wasn't quite sure what tags to use
                  because I was still learning.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And also on being canon-compliant,
                  but still ... I was working in an area where there was nothing for canon yet. I'm
                  assuming that with the comics now, we'll get more information on that regard. But
                  at
                  the time, there was nothing in that area. So I wanted it to be known that it was
                  still within canon's bounds, but there were going to be things being explored that
                  weren't articulated in canon.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>
                  And in terms of relationships and love and so forth, it was I guess just coming back
                  to what I like to explore in fiction, which is how people are interacting with each
                  other, what it means for them. And especially for certain characters who are ... I'm
                  not sure how I'm thinking of this, but I think what I'm thinking of is where the
                  audience may usually dismiss them or not consider them worthy of further
                  exploration. So I like to see for myself how their worth is existing within these
                  relationships, what it means for them and what it can mean for the audience and so
                  forth.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Whereas, for
                  Asami, Asami didn't have anyone, or at least maybe in her head she didn't have
                  anyone. So she went back to someone, I
                  guess who is an ... I wouldn't say an abuser because there isn't that dynamic
                  for them. But in the way that the relationship shifts from love and care to an
                  act of violence ... I don't know. I just wanted to explore
                  that. It's just fascinating to me to see how people who were deeply hurt somehow
                  still find a way to circle back around to the people who have hurt
                  them.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>The universe raises really
                  interesting conversations about inequality and power and change and so forth, but
                  we
                  kind of always see it from the position of the privileged. And I think that's my favorite
                  thing about fandom
                  and fan fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that
                  either there wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important
                  enough to explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always
                  in the forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the
                  world," not just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
                  through.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I think I'd actually forgotten about this until
                  someone else had written it in their own fanfiction, which is part of what's so fun
                  about reading fanfiction. There are all these ideas that you don't quite pickup on
                  right away, but someone else mentions it, and it clicks, and you start to rotate the
                  world and look at it from a different angle.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Mainly regarding the pairings that would
                  show up, it would be mainly non-hetero pairings if that makes more sense than
                  just saying a pairing because there would be some exploring of gender and what
                  not with some characters. Or I would definitely be focusing on male-male or
                  female-female relationships as well, because a lot of the media already does a lot
                  of
                  the male-female exploration. And a lot of the purpose of fandom
                  is to sort of explore beyond what we're just given.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>You never
                  really hear about what Jaime thought about it. I sort of delved into this idea trying
                  to explore Jaime reacquainting himself
                  with these things later on in life, but through a modern lens because I also
                  wanted to be able to relate to it as well.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
                  Jaime and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
                  because obviously they wouldn't be having as
                  much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
                  considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
                  day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
                  from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
                  versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
                  wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
                  identity. But there would definitely be some push
                  back, but how would that change based on the setting?
                  I made her a little bit more comfortable in
                  her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
                  shoulder for Jaime
                  who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
                  well.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, definitely when it comes to trying to write it
                  realistically as well, but the banter back and forth was very difficult. I read a
                  lot of fanfic where it can be very stalkish and when I think about it and I think
                  about someone saying it out loud, I just like cringe. My face caves in.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>from the source material where I wanted to kind of
                  explore Jaime's perspective on this, but through a modern lens and later on in life
                  because a lot of Jaime's self-realization in the book comes after he meets Brienne
                  as well.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to actually put some Game
                  of Thrones content on those tags to begin with because back when I was writing it,
                  there wasn't a lot really going for it. LGBT fanfics, yeah sure, but
                  gender fluid and gender
                  related things, it wasn't really there.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Like, where is this content that
                  should be out there because it's in the books and why is no one taking this up and
                  writing about it?</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think I would want to go
                  more into maybe tagging some of the triggers maybe now a days because back then
                  there wasn't as much of a discussion around it. Now a days, you have more of a
                  discussion around what bigger tags to put in to help people avoid it for instance.
                  Now that AO3 has updated its tagging system to include and exclude.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I just find their relationship in
                  canon to be so interesting because it was one of
                  the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
                  pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
                  surprised.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>There's a lot of, again, fanfic already out there of
                  them being intimate, but it was all
                  very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
                  vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
                  I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
                  own instead.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>even in the context of like the canon,
                  he always had a very strange affinity, but
                  like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
                  loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point
                  of view.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think he definitely
                  is someone that would pick up on someone's interests and what not and what that
                  means to them, either subconsciously or consciously channel it when he's handling
                  it.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That's definitely
                  something that is taught in canon with him, in terms of never showing your full hand
                  of cards to the enemy, being deceitful and it's all to reach your goal. I think that
                  would still carry over to a modern setting, but it would be more toned down into a
                  more reasonable kind of thing like, "I don't want to seem like this is actually for
                  me. I'm buying it for someone else." If I don't want to get lambasted or judged or
                  anything like that. Residual toxic masculinity and
                  all of that.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted
                  to still carry over the kind of relationship that Jaime and Tywin had in the TV show
                  in the medieval setting, but to modernize it more again, but not take away the fact
                  that Tywin was a very controlling father.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of recreate the feelings that I had when I was
                  reading Jaime and Brienne in their notorious bath house scene. Where this was this
                  very raw moment where Jaime opened up and did his monologue about a knight's duty
                  and how it was, pardon my language, full of shit.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted something similar, but would still
                  make me feel like that, but wanted to make it more intimate and feel like it was
                  still just as opening, but with actions and not just with words.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I ship Sansa and Marjory and I tried to write fic for
                  them, but I
                  don't know why it never picked up. Marjory just walked around the whole show
                  just hitting on everyone. I was like why isn't there more of this? It's
                  literally right here.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Sandor and Sansa, I will say that I like their ship name
                  as San-San. I do understand the whole
                  like rough, the woman that warms his heart thing. Again, it's all very like
                  romance novel-y prompts when I've tried to find fic and I'm just like, "I'll
                  just write a Nora Roberts novel." I'd so read her books if I
                  wanted to. I don't need to read them here.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, it's depressingly small. I know that when I was writing it, there was a lot
                  less fanfic, but you would think even with Jaime and Brienne having that very
                  unique friendship/relationship</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I would almost want to just write fic out of
                  spite.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I had some really bad, some
                  really heated discussions with a friend on my dashboard on Twitter. We just did that,
                  like Brienne was actually fully a lesbian
                  and that she hated people linking her with Jaime. And I'm like, "That's an
                  interesting concept, not canon, but concept." She was fighting people on the
                  dashboard about it with the sort of bigger, than someone who has like facts in
                  front of them would argue. And I'm like, "I understand, but this is your
                  interpretation." People who ship her with Jaime don't hate lesbians. Please, do
                  not try and put this away. Yeah, it was a whole mess. People
                  came out in droves, angry for different reasons.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then people would be like, "Oh, your fanfic is
                  this like this one, so why don't you go read this fanfic?" It kind of was a jumping
                  off point for me.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
                  Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
                  Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
                  no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
                  brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
                  thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
                  wrote a Game of Thrones fanfiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
                  series, the first one.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
                  know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Doctor Who episodes is Turn Left.
                  And
                  it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
                  What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
                  And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
                  and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
                  the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
                  that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
                  world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
                  would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
                  maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
                  how I got into that.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That I've actually
                  written about 200 pages for. But that was just the one pivotal scene. So I was like,
                  okay, I'm just going to take you out and put you here, and then leave you
                  alone.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But all of a suddenly, this particular set of characters is no longer in the
                  picture. So how does that affect everything else? How does Daenerys Targaryen deal
                  with a kingdom that is pretty much united with a war hero still on the throne?</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think the strength is, I do try and keep it as much as
                  I can in character, and in situ, I guess. I don't like to pull too much of other
                  outside influences in. I think the strength is that people can read it and they can
                  really see it sliding into canon. And if you go into something aside, you don't have
                  to bump too much. And it would fit in the overall narrative.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I have a very hard time
                  getting into certain characters' heads, and seeing like, okay, is this the
                  motivation that they would have? Because I do take that very seriously. So, there
                  are times I'm just like, I can't see this person doing this. I can't see them doing
                  that. How do I get this to fit in with their character and not make it too over the
                  top, or too OOC? That's one of my main challenges.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because one thing as a writer that will pull me completely out of a story is if
                  there is a colloquialism that should not belong. Or if
                  you're using words, and I'm like, okay, I've never heard that word used on the show,
                  so now you've just dropped a bomb in the middle of a wedding cake, and there's cake
                  everywhere. It just pulls me out.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I chose Sansa in particular, and I
                  think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
                  little bit of character assassination.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted to kind of show a Sansa who was still herself.
                  A Sansa who was willing to not listen to him, who
                  understood that, this person is not my friend. This person is strictly
                  manipulative. He's going to take me somewhere that I don't want to go, so my
                  only choice is to find the strength in me that she has, and say, "Okay, I'll
                  run. If it means I have to die, I'm not going to let him use me for whatever his
                  ends are." That's kind of where that idea came from.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She was
                  supposed to kind of get lost in the trees, and they were supposed to find her. But
                  I
                  thought that was a little bit ignominious for her. So then I remembered, Oh,
                  Nimeria's wolf pack. I was like, they haven't used that in the show at all, so why
                  not?</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
                  of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
                  That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
                  delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
                  Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
                  away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
                  one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
                  fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
                  of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
                  if I was a former slave. The one thing I
                  would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
                  in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
                  into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
                  anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
                  like to see a bit more of that in Game of Thrones fanfiction. She's really an
                  underused character.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
                  thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
                  in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
                  and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
                  unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
                  me
                  try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
                  There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
                  improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>The
                  "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
                  People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
                  right there." So I had the "What if."</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Tags are hard because they are, it takes me...
                  The hardest part of my posting is tagging, to make sure that I have everything
                  right.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Out of character? I
                  never know. I think my
                  characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
                  "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
                  it may be out of character."</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Alternate universe, canon
                  divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
                  want to get blasted on that one.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Missandei deserved
                  better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
                  they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
                  would. And then, [inaudible 00:24:23].</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
                  agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
                  dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
                  that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
                  Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
                  we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
                  that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
                  her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
                  supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
                  that.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
                  beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
                  thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And like she says in the fic even
                  if I get bit by a lizard-lion or I starve, that's my choice. But it won't be going
                  back
                  to a ruined Winterfell to marry a legitimized bastard.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was my take on the scene where Brienne and Pod meet her in the tavern, where
                  she seems to be at first a little surprised, a little relieved, and then you kind
                  of
                  see her shut down a bit.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But in my mind, I
                  didn't think she didn't want it because she didn't necessarily trust Brienne, it was
                  more because Peter would never let her go. Even if this person said, "I'm going to
                  help you," he would never allow that, because he
                  wants control of her, and that is something that she realizes, because she's not
                  an idiot. She's seen this man in King's Landing, she sees how
                  he operates. She sees how he operates in the Eyrie. If he doesn't have total control
                  of her, he's not going to allow it. And the best way to do that would be to get rid
                  of these two people. And she doesn't want anyone to die for her. So that was kind
                  of
                  my read on that situation.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It doesn't matter if it's to save my life. Even if you
                  said that okay, "This is the only thing you can do to survive," at this point, she's
                  run. She's re-discovered her strength. She's
                  done something that she didn't think she could do. She got away
                  for a time. So, at this point she's just like, "No, I can't do it. I won't do it."
                  That was kind of that whole, what that
                  episode was about was Sansa really re-discovering herself, and what she could
                  do.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So yeah, [Missandei]'s such an interesting character. There's
                  so much about her that could be written that isn't written. I just kind of wanted
                  to
                  investigate a little bit. What would life have been like for this character?</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>These were all things she's done because she believes in
                  Daenerys' vision, she believes in a world
                  without slavery. And after having been a slave and experienced freedom, that's
                  something she'd want for everybody. I hate to say it, Harriet Tubman, how many
                  times did she go back and she got slaves and ran them back out? Simply because
                  I'm free, no one should be in bondage, even if it's a personal risk to myself,
                  to my life, that is a risk I will take, because everyone should be free. And I
                  think as a former slave, Missandei really would have that
                  sentiment.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
                  seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
                  woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
                  anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
                  back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
                  Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
                  slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
                  she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
                  jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
                  great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
                  I've seen it before.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's a smile of, I
                  can't think of the word, but being resigned to my fate. And if this is it, then this
                  is it. And like I say, she recognizes in Cersei the same evil that she saw in
                  Astapor where she's kind of like, "No, you
                  would have fit in well with them. You may think that you're better, you may
                  think that you're better than people from Astapor. You may think that you're
                  better than slave owners and all this, that, and the other, but in the end you
                  are not. You are exactly like them." And in the end, she kind
                  of wants to let her know. It's kind of like a, "I know that you know that I know
                  that you know" moment. Like, I see you. You can't hide from me. I see exactly what
                  you are.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Like I
                  said, as a slave, as someone who's been freed, I can't imagine her ever wanting to
                  be in a situation where somebody would be using her against her will. And that would
                  be one thing I imagine you would promise yourself. Kind of like, I hate to use the
                  comparison, but if you ever get out of a really bad relationship, and you're just
                  like, "No, never again. I know the signs. I will never let that happen to me again."
                  And for her of course it's more extreme,
                  from being someone who was taken from freedom and put into slavery, lived a
                  decade plus as a slave, not having a will of their own, and then suddenly
                  getting that will back. No one's ever taking that from me. Like I said, I've
                  found myself. Now that I've found myself again, and I can be myself, I will die
                  myself.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's one thing, to me, if it's too OOC, just out of
                  the block  there's no real change, and these drabbles are
                  so short. You can't really see a lot of character development from A to B.
                  Everything kind of has to fit where it does. So I wanted to make sure that it fit
                  and it wasn't too crazy. It's a lot of research.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But I can
                  see, especially in Season Five, and Six, and Seven, where you see Jon Snow, Sansa
                  Stark, because these two characters kind of get back together in the show. When
                  they're together, you can see their dynamic in everything else. And they look good
                  together. That's always a good thing. It's always big when it comes to shipping, who
                  looks good with who.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think it's the same with, I'm also very
                  active in the Star Wars fandom, and that's one thing you see in a lot of Star Wars,
                  especially the new trilogy. People love taking the characters out of where they are
                  and
                  putting them in today. That doesn't surprise me at all.</li>

         <h2>Uptake: Critical Uptake</h2>
           <div class="interview-search-analysis">
         <h3>Description</h3>
         <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors discuss critical uptakes. Uptakes are the ways in which a writer responds to one genre by engaging in another genre, following particular conventions or expectations for how to engage with the second genre. A critical uptake occurs “when writers...resist harmful and exclusive cultural ideologies in their uptake” (<a href="https://wac.colostate.edu/docs/jwa/vol3/messina.pdf">Messina, 2019</a>). These ideologies may be embedded in the canonical show or even fan genre conventions.
         </p>
         <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 39</p>
         <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Each of the authors reflects on critically uptaking a genre, each citing motivations along with their choices in their fanfics. For Kittya Cullen, Aria, Gillywulf, and Writegirl, they challenge how particular characters or groups of people are represented in either the original text or fanfic genre conventions. To write fanfic is not only to engage with the texts, characters, and universes, but to recognize genre conventions from the original texts and either mirror or challenge them.</p>
         <p>Fantasy television shows or movies, like GOT, often replicate misogynistic and/or racist conventions in the texts. In GOT, Writegirl argues the writers removed both Sansa’s and Missandei’s agency. Writegirl’s fic is a critical uptake of fantasy genre conventions in which women characters — particularly women characters of color — are subjected to constant violence. Writegirl explicitly states that she “wanted [Sansa] to have a little bit more agency” and she wanted to give Missandei “some of her dignity back.” Kittya Cullen, too, explains that her early writing was satirical as a way to critique the original texts. The satire genre often mimics generic conventions with an intent to both humor an audience as well as address specific political ideologies. Satire, when produced with a critical eye, is almost always a critical uptake because of its familiarity and resistance to particular generic conventions.</p>

         <p>While Gillywulf and Valk do not discuss combating specific harmful conventions from the original texts, both address conventions they notice in the large fandom community and fanfic genres. Gillywulf provides a specific example of critical uptake: her TLOK fanfic was a series of short vignettes — 400 vignettes in total — based on prompts offered by other fans. She specifically addresses two prompts: one that asks her to write about a teacher/student relationship and one that asks her to write a slavefic. Both genres are popular in fandoms. The teacher/student relationship imagines a sexual and intimate relationship between a teacher and student, while slavefics imagine a sexual and intimate relationship between a person enslaved and the person who enslaved them. Both genres fetishize the harmful power dynamics.</p>
         <p>The critical uptake, here, is seamless and easy to trace. First, there is the general genres of slavefics and teacher/student relationships; then, there is the prompt genre in which one fan requests another fan to produce something; finally, there’s Gillywulf’s actual fic. She knows the conventions well, but instead of accepting the prompt, her fics actively resist these conventions because she “didn't want to contribute to it.” Instead of writing a conventional slavefic between Korra and Asami, Gillywulf imagines that Korra is enslaved by Asami’s father and Asami straight up refuses to accept her father’s “gift.” Instead, Asami promises to free Korra. There is no mention of a sexual relationship. For the teacher/student relationship fic, Gillywulf imagines Asami — the teacher — actively refusing Korra’s—the students’ — sexual advancements. In many teacher/student fics, the student usually initiates the relationship, almost attempting to placate the uncomfortable power dynamics; even if the teacher is hesitant at first, they wind up accepting the students’ advances. Several prompts after kept asking Gillywulf to expand on this story, and she complied, reimaging Korra as a recent college graduate, rather than Asami’s current student.</p>
         <p>Valk also discusses fan genre conventions that trouble them, specifically the “incredily heteronormative” conventions in GOT fanfics. Valk points out how the romance genre — specifically romance fics depicting Jaime’s and Brienne’s relationship — usually celebrates traditional gender roles. Valk says, “Just their gender roles and Brienne being vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.” One of the reasons Valk chose to write their fanfic, which reimagines Jaime (canonically cis male) as exploring his gender identity, to challenge these heteronormative conventions, or as Valk said “so I wrote my own instead.”</p>
         <p>Finally, while many of the critical uptakes involve the authors challenging a particular convention they find troubling, both Kittya Cullen and Aria discuss the importance of fiction and fandoms to reshape readers’ perspectives and engage them politically. Aria says, “there's a study I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about things you don't convince them, but if you tell stories you can.” Aria’s fiction centers storytelling for the purpose of reaching and convincing others. Her uptake of original texts and fanfic genres are explicitly to engage others’ critical thinking. Kittya Cullen expresses a similar reason for writing and reading fiction, explaining that one of her goals is “how can [she] better represent experiences of people in the world?” Aria and Kittya explicitly state these motivations that drive their critical writing and uptakes, but these motivations to reshape the world and readers’ perspectives linger through every author’s responses.</p>

            <h3>Quotes</h3>
            <ul>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>When I'm writing this fic it means something, because I'm like... There's a study
                  I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about things you don't
                  convince them, but if you tell stories you can. And I think that I'm in that place,
                  arguing about politics in the fiction space of the internet.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And then I wrote a piece called [inaudible 00:05:42], which was sort of like a revisiting
                  of what does... I guess it was actually about immigration, it's just I never really
                  ever got around to doing a piece about immigration system, but somebody had a bad
                  take about immigration in America in a piece of fanfic and I was like, "God, that's
                  a really bad understanding of that friend. That is utopian and wrong."</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
                  context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
                  very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
                  you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
                  original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
                  through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
                  and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
                  with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
                  get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
                  you.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was coming into my own politically, I was becoming my own political individual in
                  a way I hadn't been before. Like I had politics, but this is around the time that
                  I'm really radicalized, and just me engaging with those contexts.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
                  a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
                  different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
                  in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
                  and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
                  looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I was under the impression, reading or engaging with this text, I came away with
                  this feeling like the Northern Water Tribe is somewhat... very different from the
                  rest of the world, and there are ways that it plays as... I don't know if it was textual
                  or sort of fan-driven more, but I remember coming away with this feeling that there
                  is a marginalized subjectivity in the Northern Water Tribe. And so telling this story
                  about difference in culture, and we'll get to... I'll get to Korra's upbringing a
                  little bit later, because you're going to ask about 10 minutes later about Korra's
                  upbringing. But I want to... Basically that I think Korra's upbringing is particularly
                  reflective of that culture, yeah.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I come away from Korra feeling like, "This is a gender thing going on." I don't buy
                  that there's not homophobia in a world with gender in the like weird way that... In
                  ways that still reflect our I think gender and homophobia [inaudible 00:21:13], the
                  way that we have a sense of gender. Big, capital G Gender. And so I thought like,
                  "What does it mean to have culture in the context of... What does it mean to be a
                  cosmopolitan city where... There's both a degree of marginalization for like the Northern
                  Water Tribe closing... Not so much that rules that are really intended to enforce
                  gender norms are going to be there. And also to be like, "Yeah, there's probably a
                  different understanding of gender in context," yeah.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Whereas Korra grows up in this institution, Asami grows up with a relatively politically
                  progressive father. He's an abuser, but he's also a very, very politically progressive
                  man. He's a radical, he tries to overthrow his government, make the world a more equitable
                  and fair place. It's self-interested, he's a bourgeois radical, but I wouldn't have
                  said that at the time. I imagine Asami as having a relatively normal, relatively healthy
                  understanding of the world in a way, having felt like she, not just knowing that a
                  woman can love another woman, because I guess almost every person in this world knows.
                  This is nothing like, Korra is particularly going to have a hard time because of that
                  institution itself.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So to me, Hiroshi's both a man that would destroy his children for the things he believes,
                  and in some sense for his own power. But also a man who genuinely is providing aid
                  and comfort and resources for fighting for what he views as liberation, and that liberation's
                  probably genuine at some level. I think it's fair to say that there is a political
                  bender-like supremacy at the beginning. I mean there is, we know there's a bender
                  supremacy at the beginning of The Legend of Korra. And so that's how I understand
                  Hiroshi.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wanted to give a sense of what is the politics of the Northern Water Tribe? And
                  I kind of wanted to say that queerness isn't criminalized in the Northern Water Tribe,
                  or is not criminalized anymore. Also I wanted to say this is a different relationship.
                  But the other thing I wanted to talk about is, what are politicians willing to give
                  up for their family, and what are they not?</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Because I know what our reactionary politics is like, I think I'd start around the
                  time that Kuvira is beginning to gain power. I'd write it as a story that talks about
                  immigration, and talks about sweeping panic and fear that spill off of that. I'd probably
                  talk about gender through those lenses, and I'd probably talk about humanity in a
                  slightly more complex... I'd probably make it a story that... I'd probably both use
                  modern messages to say that, I'd probably talk more about police state, and police
                  state as endless spying networks where you don't know when you're being spied on and
                  when you're not, and endless police states</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also, if you're looking at a subtext, my people they were like, "Oh yeah, I want to
                  tell this story, I want to finish this story." And there's a degree to which it a
                  queer reading, there's this political tendency to look at fiction and say, "I am going
                  to tell the story you didn't." And so during the subtext period, you've already got
                  these people who are basically being like, "Yo, I'm going to tell this story.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
                  love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
                  stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
                  of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
                  of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
                  "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
                  who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
                  of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And then, just
                  seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
                  once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
                  not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
                  the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
                  there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
                  </li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
                  super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
                  of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
                  relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
                  should take five steps back, and let's just
                  focus on these two.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
                  it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
                  press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" Because I just find keeping people as
                  slaves is super ... I didn't want to
                  contribute to it, and it was just that sort of idea
                  [inaudible 00:47:42] maybe are younger and a little bit
                  more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
                  been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
                  thing.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Especially with the prompts and setting boundaries like you
                  mentioned earlier. It's writing what you want.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>To
                  realizing that there was a community of people who were also interested in
                  discussing how these shows and books and games et cetera were failing us, whether
                  it
                  was in terms of the content or the representation or just releasing new things like
                  thought arcs that weren't followed through on.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Actually, I completely forgot, there was a
                  period where I would write like a satirical review of what was happening, because
                  I
                  don't do that anymore for anything really. But it was an opportunity to experiment
                  with writing and being critical of source materials and so on.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>
                  And in terms of relationships and love and so forth, it was I guess just coming back
                  to what I like to explore in fiction, which is how people are interacting with each
                  other, what it means for them. And especially for certain characters who are ... I'm
                  not sure how I'm thinking of this, but I think what I'm thinking of is where the
                  audience may usually dismiss them or not consider them worthy of further
                  exploration. So I like to see for myself how their worth is existing within these
                  relationships, what it means for them and what it can mean for the audience and so
                  forth.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>The universe raises really
                  interesting conversations about inequality and power and change and so forth, but
                  we
                  kind of always see it from the position of the privileged. And I think that's my favorite
                  thing about fandom
                  and fan fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that
                  either there wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important
                  enough to explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always
                  in the forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the
                  world," not just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
                  through.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I think I'd actually forgotten about this until
                  someone else had written it in their own fanfiction, which is part of what's so fun
                  about reading fanfiction. There are all these ideas that you don't quite pickup on
                  right away, but someone else mentions it, and it clicks, and you start to rotate the
                  world and look at it from a different angle.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Mainly regarding the pairings that would
                  show up, it would be mainly non-hetero pairings if that makes more sense than
                  just saying a pairing because there would be some exploring of gender and what
                  not with some characters. Or I would definitely be focusing on male-male or
                  female-female relationships as well, because a lot of the media already does a lot
                  of
                  the male-female exploration. And a lot of the purpose of fandom
                  is to sort of explore beyond what we're just given.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to actually put some Game
                  of Thrones content on those tags to begin with because back when I was writing it,
                  there wasn't a lot really going for it. LGBT fanfics, yeah sure, but
                  gender fluid and gender
                  related things, it wasn't really there.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Like, where is this content that
                  should be out there because it's in the books and why is no one taking this up and
                  writing about it?</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>There's a lot of, again, fanfic already out there of
                  them being intimate, but it was all
                  very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
                  vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
                  I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
                  own instead.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, it's depressingly small. I know that when I was writing it, there was a lot
                  less fanfic, but you would think even with Jaime and Brienne having that very
                  unique friendship/relationship</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I would almost want to just write fic out of
                  spite.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
                  of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
                  That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
                  delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
                  Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
                  away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
                  one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
                  fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
                  of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
                  if I was a former slave. The one thing I
                  would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
                  in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
                  into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
                  anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
                  like to see a bit more of that in Game of Thrones fanfiction. She's really an
                  underused character.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Missandei deserved
                  better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
                  they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
                  would. And then, [inaudible 00:24:23].</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
                  agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
                  dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
                  that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
                  Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
                  we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
                  that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
                  her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
                  supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
                  that.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
                  beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
                  thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And like she says in the fic even
                  if I get bit by a lizard-lion or I starve, that's my choice. But it won't be going
                  back
                  to a ruined Winterfell to marry a legitimized bastard.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It doesn't matter if it's to save my life. Even if you
                  said that okay, "This is the only thing you can do to survive," at this point, she's
                  run. She's re-discovered her strength. She's
                  done something that she didn't think she could do. She got away
                  for a time. So, at this point she's just like, "No, I can't do it. I won't do it."
                  That was kind of that whole, what that
                  episode was about was Sansa really re-discovering herself, and what she could
                  do.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>These were all things she's done because she believes in
                  Daenerys' vision, she believes in a world
                  without slavery. And after having been a slave and experienced freedom, that's
                  something she'd want for everybody. I hate to say it, Harriet Tubman, how many
                  times did she go back and she got slaves and ran them back out? Simply because
                  I'm free, no one should be in bondage, even if it's a personal risk to myself,
                  to my life, that is a risk I will take, because everyone should be free. And I
                  think as a former slave, Missandei really would have that
                  sentiment.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
                  seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
                  woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
                  anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
                  back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
                  Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
                  slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
                  she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
                  jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
                  great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
                  I've seen it before.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's a smile of, I
                  can't think of the word, but being resigned to my fate. And if this is it, then this
                  is it. And like I say, she recognizes in Cersei the same evil that she saw in
                  Astapor where she's kind of like, "No, you
                  would have fit in well with them. You may think that you're better, you may
                  think that you're better than people from Astapor. You may think that you're
                  better than slave owners and all this, that, and the other, but in the end you
                  are not. You are exactly like them." And in the end, she kind
                  of wants to let her know. It's kind of like a, "I know that you know that I know
                  that you know" moment. Like, I see you. You can't hide from me. I see exactly what
                  you are.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Like I
                  said, as a slave, as someone who's been freed, I can't imagine her ever wanting to
                  be in a situation where somebody would be using her against her will. And that would
                  be one thing I imagine you would promise yourself. Kind of like, I hate to use the
                  comparison, but if you ever get out of a really bad relationship, and you're just
                  like, "No, never again. I know the signs. I will never let that happen to me again."
                  And for her of course it's more extreme,
                  from being someone who was taken from freedom and put into slavery, lived a
                  decade plus as a slave, not having a will of their own, and then suddenly
                  getting that will back. No one's ever taking that from me. Like I said, I've
                  found myself. Now that I've found myself again, and I can be myself, I will die
                  myself.</li>

         <h2>Uptake: Canon Compliant</h2>
         <div class="interview-search-analysis">
         <h3>Description</h3>
         <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When a fan celebrates and follows a particular event or character in the original source material (<a href="https://wac.colostate.edu/docs/jwa/vol3/messina.pdf">Messina, 2019</a>). AThe term “canon compliant” comes from a popular “Additional Tag” used on AO3 when authors share that their fanfic follow canon. All fanfiction is canon compliant in that it follows from a source material. However, fan communities can vary in the degree to which they allow writers within the community to deviate from the origin source, i.e., the canon. Canon compliant uptakes may include writing a canonical relationship or continuing a canonical plot point. In other words, writers extend an existing story, rather than revising or changing the original character relationships or plots.</p>
         <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 31</p>
         <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Canon compliant uptakes emerge when fans love something in the original text and want to replicate or build upon it in their uptake. Both Aria and Gillywulf use the word “excited” to express the affective relationship between the fan writer, the canonical material, and the fanfic the writer produces.</p>
         <p>In TLOK, when Asami and Korra’s budding romance — and therefore their bisexuality — is confirmed canon in the last minute of the show, the fandom erupted with excitement and produced numerous fanfics using the “canon compliant” tag (more about this can be found in “<a href="/case_studies/ship_is_canon.html">Fandoms by Numbers</a>”). Aria, while reviewing some of the larger tagging trends, pointed out the large increase of “canon compliant” and “canon queer relationship” tags the series finale aired. Tagging practices, such as “canon compliant,” are a method for fan writers to signal to potential readers the different genre conventions and/or content that their piece contains.</p>
         <p>Although canon compliant material was found in both fandoms analyzed, the GOT fanfic authors focused more on capturing particular dynamics — cultural and relationship — and characters in their canon compliant uptakes. While Dialux’s, Valk’s, and Writegirl’s pieces do not fall under the “canon compliant” genre — Dialux and Valk are alternate universes and Writegirl is canon divergent, fix-it fics — they make particular choices in their writing that mirror the canonical text. By pulling particular conventions from the original fantasy genre, these writers demonstrate how conventions span across different genres. For example, Dialux believes the regional and cultural tensions in GOT between the North and King’s Landing are similar to those between the Rajput and a Mughal in 16th century India, as depicted in the historical film <cite>Jodhaa Akbar</cite>. Her piece revolves around these regional, cultural, and religious tensions; she takes up conventions of how to represent cultural difference from two different genres and uses them in a third genre — her racebent, alternate universe fic.</p>
         <p>Valk and Writegirl also bring in particular canon compliant choices into their non-canonical fics. Valk centers the tense canonical relationship between Jaime and his father in the original text, and brings that tension into their fic. And even though Writegirl’s fix-it fics reimagine the canon, she wants to make sure her readers can “they can really see [her fic] sliding into canon.” For her, this means also retaining characters’ voices and perspectives to ensure they are not OOC, or “out of character.”</p>
         <p>While choosing to mirror particular characters, relationships, and dynamics in a fic is not necessarily a genre in of itself, there are clear expectations in fandoms that fanfics will mirror the canon in character voice and action, unless explicitly stated otherwise. Fanfic writers’ choice to follow canonical details and dynamics is part of fanfic genre expectations, and therefore a form of canon compliant uptake.</p>

            <h3>Quotes</h3>
            <ul>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong> There are things I don't like about it, but I like it as a little bit of text. It's
                  there in the text, it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love
                  feeling represented." So I wrote that.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I was just engaging with the text's portrayal of trauma.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
                  a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
                  but it's good.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First guess is actually that there's a) an explosion of stories that aren't canon
                  compliant, so people are staying people are saying, "This story is canon compliant,"
                  as a way of engaging. In terms of, it makes sense to say something's canon-compliant
                  sort of at the end of the piece, because once the story is over then it makes sense
                  to go back and say, "actually this is canon compliant." A lot of stories before a
                  story ends it's already like, "How could this go from here?" And so I would imagine
                  that the canon compliance people were like, "Well, I'm telling this story based on
                  what literally happened," instead of all of these other tellings that I'm seeing now.
                  That would be my first guess. My second guess is that people are excited to tell stories
                  that were literally just after the end of The Legend of Korra</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I imagine that it's because... It makes sense to tell a friendship story with characters
                  who are already very close friends, and characters who are becoming close friends.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I mean, canon queer relationship is more common because there is canon queer relationship.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>because it looks to me here that what you're seeing is a movement from seeing the
                  word girlfriend in a context of a text that's about a set of texts about relationships
                  in a more heterosexual perspective, in a story about women. Because it looks to me
                  that this is a story that, if you see jealous there, that looks like I'm looking at
                  a piece that's from Korra's point of view. But then if I'm looking at boyfriend, I'm
                  also thinking about Korra and Mako.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then, of course, you have the Targaryen
                  colors, which are black, which are mourning colors according to the Western
                  culture. And all of it kind of comes together. And, of course,
                  Rajput culture is known for its red, its vibrant, blood red. And obviously, that's
                  a
                  Targaryen color.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But within this particular fic, as I said earlier, I
                  really wanted to already have that tension. Especially that religious tension between
                  Jon and
                  Sansa. And have that difference, where both of them and neither of them are
                  willing to compromise on that.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the regional tensions, I think, are already
                  there in the canon.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And, I mean, we don't know if she relies more on
                  her religion because she left her homeland, and came to the North. And just
                  wanted some desperate way, something to rely on that's her family, or that
                  reminded her of home. But to me, at least, I can imagine, especially the actual
                  Jodhaa, going to Akbar's Islamic court. And basically being all alone, and not
                  having very many allies. And finding some sort of a solace in her religion of
                  Hinduism.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
                  very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
                  queer
                  characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
                  go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
                  their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
                  situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And
                  okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
                  notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
                  figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
                  she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
                  Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes. So, those
                  things stand out immediately.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Even in the modern drabbles, or the
                  other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
                  she can access that.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And for Asami, she's gorgeous. Let's be honest. She's
                  gorgeous. So, you notice that, but also, with the death of her mother at a young
                  age, she's sad and growing up with the rich father,
                  she has certain expectations placed on her and where she's going to go in her
                  life according to that company, so she has to be sort of poised and on her toes
                  all the time.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, it's kind of just how I always
                  imagined her parents were just going to always be there for her. And we do see that
                  in season three, where she's immediately going to bat for them and each
                  other.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, I just tried to stay true to that, I guess, in some
                  regard, as far as her relationship went.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, for that chapter, I want to say, like everything
                  else in the collection, it was a prompt, but it was something that I didn't want to
                  ham-fist it, because Korra's definitely, she's
                  traumatized. We see that more than once,</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>even
                  though I will always love Korra and Asami, it's not necessarily always easy to write
                  for that, if you're not getting constant updates for it.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
                  was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
                  possible love interests.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"Korrasami's canon. That's
                  what it is." So, a lot of people were super excited about that, especially since,
                  up to that point, there really hadn't been
                  a whole lot of huge representation for female ships.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, to
                  see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
                  god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
                  have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And also on being canon-compliant,
                  but still ... I was working in an area where there was nothing for canon yet. I'm
                  assuming that with the comics now, we'll get more information on that regard. But
                  at
                  the time, there was nothing in that area. So I wanted it to be known that it was
                  still within canon's bounds, but there were going to be things being explored that
                  weren't articulated in canon.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted
                  to still carry over the kind of relationship that Jaime and Tywin had in the TV show
                  in the medieval setting, but to modernize it more again, but not take away the fact
                  that Tywin was a very controlling father.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of recreate the feelings that I had when I was
                  reading Jaime and Brienne in their notorious bath house scene. Where this was this
                  very raw moment where Jaime opened up and did his monologue about a knight's duty
                  and how it was, pardon my language, full of shit.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted something similar, but would still
                  make me feel like that, but wanted to make it more intimate and feel like it was
                  still just as opening, but with actions and not just with words.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think the strength is, I do try and keep it as much as
                  I can in character, and in situ, I guess. I don't like to pull too much of other
                  outside influences in. I think the strength is that people can read it and they can
                  really see it sliding into canon. And if you go into something aside, you don't have
                  to bump too much. And it would fit in the overall narrative.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I have a very hard time
                  getting into certain characters' heads, and seeing like, okay, is this the
                  motivation that they would have? Because I do take that very seriously. So, there
                  are times I'm just like, I can't see this person doing this. I can't see them doing
                  that. How do I get this to fit in with their character and not make it too over the
                  top, or too OOC? That's one of my main challenges.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because one thing as a writer that will pull me completely out of a story is if
                  there is a colloquialism that should not belong. Or if
                  you're using words, and I'm like, okay, I've never heard that word used on the show,
                  so now you've just dropped a bomb in the middle of a wedding cake, and there's cake
                  everywhere. It just pulls me out.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's one thing, to me, if it's too OOC, just out of
                  the block  there's no real change, and these drabbles are
                  so short. You can't really see a lot of character development from A to B.
                  Everything kind of has to fit where it does. So I wanted to make sure that it fit
                  and it wasn't too crazy. It's a lot of research.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But I can
                  see, especially in Season Five, and Six, and Seven, where you see Jon Snow, Sansa
                  Stark, because these two characters kind of get back together in the show. When
                  they're together, you can see their dynamic in everything else. And they look good
                  together. That's always a good thing. It's always big when it comes to shipping, who
                  looks good with who.</li>

         <h2>Uptake: Canon Resistant</h2>
         <div class="interview-search-analysis">
         <h3>Description</h3>
         <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors discuss a canon resistant uptake, which is when a fan actively “resists both the implicit and explicit canonical choices made in the original cultural material” (<a href="https://wac.colostate.edu/docs/jwa/vol3/messina.pdf">Messina, 2019</a>). This may include writing about a non-canonical relationship, identity bending, or reimagining an alternative plot point.</p>
         <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 19</p>
         <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The canon resistant uptakes demonstrated in the interviews often begin with the writers’ affective responses to a particular moment, choice, or character from the original show. These affective responses may be negative or positive depending on the author’s interpretation of the show, choices made in the show, and the author’s positionality.</p>
         <p>Several authors cite they were unhappy with certain choices from the original show that drove them to take their fics in a canon divergent direction. Aria expressed discomfort with the representation of PTSD and trauma in TLOK; she argues the show does not necessarily reflect the reality of living with trauma. In TLOK, Korra recovers from her physical wounds and seems to be able to move past her PTSD, yet Aria points out that many people who experience PTSD have to learn to live with it instead of recovering from it. Writegirl was unhappy with the direction the GOT show writers chose, specifically inconsistencies and plot holes; she specifically uses the phrase “irksome.” She talks about her choice to reimagine Sansa’s storyline, claiming Sansa “suffered a little bit of character assassination.”</p>
         <p>Of course, even with their unhappiness, Aria, Writegirl, and the other authors love the source material, as they most likely would not be writing fanfiction for it otherwise. There are other authors, such as Gillywulf, who love specific details or characters in the show that they wanted to capture in their canon resistant uptakes. Gillywulf, for example, began to write romantic Korra/Asami (Korrasami) fanfiction before their romance became part of the official show. Choosing to pair a couple together that is not paired on the original show is a form of canon resistant uptake. Gillywulf talks specifically about wlw (women loving women) ships in fandoms and how fans often imagine characters as developing or having intimate relationships. She says, “ships are meant to be fun, they're not always meant to be canon.” Gillywulf’s original choice to write Korrasami fanfiction came because she liked the idea of Korra and Asami as a couple.</p>
         <p>Valk also expresses a love for Jaime and Brienne’s characters in GOT. Jaime/Brienne are the most popular ship in GOT according to the <a href="/case_studies/missandei_deserves_better.html">GOT fandom by numbers data analysis</a>, and they do have a romance on the show. Yet, Valk chooses to view Brienne and Jaime differently than many GOT fanfic writers. They reimagine Jaime, who is canonically male, as wanting to explore his gender through the use of makeup and other forms of aesthetic expression. Brienne, Jaime’s roommate in the fanfic, helps Jaime put on his makeup and supports him in his gender exploration and expression. While Valk’s entire piece is canon resistant, they particularly hone in on why they reimagine Brienne as a supportive, stable friend to Jaime; Valk reimagines Brienne as “more comfortable in her skin” than she is in GOT, potentially due to a lack of social forces pushing her to conform to particular gender roles. Valk’s choices in reimagining both Brienne and Jaime’s characters are not only canon resistant, but also resist larger trends in the Brienne/Jaime shipping fandom.</p>
         <p>These different examples — the canon resistant uptakes inspired by unhappiness or excitement from an original text’s direction — reveal how canon resistant uptakes are forms of love letters to the original show, but love letters that are written from different positionalities and ways of viewing the world than the original show.</p>

            <h3>Quotes</h3>
            <ul>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
                  context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
                  very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
                  you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
                  original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
                  through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
                  and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
                  with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
                  get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
                  you.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I initially wanted to make sure that it was pretty
                  clear to everyone that this was a canon divergence. Where one where Rhaegar has won,
                  Jon is raised a Targaryen.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>A Jon who would grow up in a Targaryen
                  court would look very different in the Targaryen [inaudible
                  00:53:09] than with a Targaryen father.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the thing is, as much as he looked like Ned on a physical level, Ned is not the
                  Ned that we see in canon. Because he's very much a person who has been basically
                  warring for however Jon has been alive.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, actually, Aishwarya Rai, who plays Jodhaa,
                  does not have brown eyes. She has hazel eyes.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But Sansa, she
                  didn't have any such love interests. I mean, obviously, I was shipping her with Jon
                  and everything. But there was no actual canonical basis for that on any
                  level.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>so it was, when I think I started it, Korrasami hadn't
                  been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
                  And maybe, I think,
                  during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
                  different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
                  strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>They wanted to be friends first, but they were so good together that I wanted to be
                  able to
                  sometimes just say they can be immediate, sometimes.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Obviously, there's always going to be people who say,
                  "I want a female ship. Going for it. I don't
                  care whether or not they necessarily gel." I'm sure there's
                  people ... I feel like I went back a million years ago and looked at the first
                  Korrasami fics, just out of curiosity, to see when they were published, and I'm sure
                  that they were like episode one, because it's just what people do, and it's great.
                  Ships are meant to be fun, they're not always meant to be canon.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
                  Jaime and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
                  because obviously they wouldn't be having as
                  much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
                  considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
                  day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
                  from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
                  versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
                  wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
                  identity. But there would definitely be some push
                  back, but how would that change based on the setting?
                  I made her a little bit more comfortable in
                  her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
                  shoulder for Jaime
                  who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
                  well.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
                  Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
                  Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
                  no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
                  brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
                  thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
                  wrote a Game of Thrones fanfiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
                  series, the first one.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
                  know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Doctor Who episodes is Turn Left.
                  And
                  it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
                  What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
                  And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
                  and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
                  the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
                  that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
                  world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
                  would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
                  maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
                  how I got into that.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That I've actually
                  written about 200 pages for. But that was just the one pivotal scene. So I was like,
                  okay, I'm just going to take you out and put you here, and then leave you
                  alone.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But all of a suddenly, this particular set of characters is no longer in the
                  picture. So how does that affect everything else? How does Daenerys Targaryen deal
                  with a kingdom that is pretty much united with a war hero still on the throne?</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I chose Sansa in particular, and I
                  think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
                  little bit of character assassination.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted to kind of show a Sansa who was still herself.
                  A Sansa who was willing to not listen to him, who
                  understood that, this person is not my friend. This person is strictly
                  manipulative. He's going to take me somewhere that I don't want to go, so my
                  only choice is to find the strength in me that she has, and say, "Okay, I'll
                  run. If it means I have to die, I'm not going to let him use me for whatever his
                  ends are." That's kind of where that idea came from.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She was
                  supposed to kind of get lost in the trees, and they were supposed to find her. But
                  I
                  thought that was a little bit ignominious for her. So then I remembered, Oh,
                  Nimeria's wolf pack. I was like, they haven't used that in the show at all, so why
                  not?</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Alternate universe, canon
                  divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
                  want to get blasted on that one.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It doesn't matter if it's to save my life. Even if you
                  said that okay, "This is the only thing you can do to survive," at this point, she's
                  run. She's re-discovered her strength. She's
                  done something that she didn't think she could do. She got away
                  for a time. So, at this point she's just like, "No, I can't do it. I won't do it."
                  That was kind of that whole, what that
                  episode was about was Sansa really re-discovering herself, and what she could
                  do.</li>

         <h2>Uptake: Implicit/Explicit</h2>
         <div class="interview-search-analysis">
         <h3>Description</h3>
         <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors discuss an implicit-explicit uptake, which is when a fan “analyzes the subtext of the show and makes the subtext explicit in their fanfictions” (<a href="https://wac.colostate.edu/docs/jwa/vol3/messina.pdf">Messina, 2019</a>). This may include writing from another characters’ perspective or exploring a romantic relationship that may be inferred.</p>
         <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 25</p>
         <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Fan author’s implicit-explicit uptakes are often motivated by them wanting to explore a particular dynamic, character, or plotline in further detail while also making assumptions based on information provided by the text — also known as interpreting the subtext. Writegirl, Valk, and Kittya each expressed curiosity about a particular character, wanting to explore that character further. Writegirl, for example, wonders what “life would have been like for [Missandei],” and uses this as motivation for her fanfic. This is an implicit-explicit uptake because Writegirl uses all her knowledge of both the show and the novels in order to make assumptions about Missandei’s backstory. Valk writes in the alternate universe genre, which is typically a canon resistant uptake.</p>
         <p>However, similar to Writegirl, Valk still wants to explore Jaime’s character based on their knowledge of the show, but in another universe that is not GOT. They point specifically to the “residual toxic masculinity” of Jaime’s character, both in the show and in their fanfic. Finally, Kittya decides to write about Asami because “I like to see how the characters are responding to what's happening to them rather than having the plot happen to them, and with Asami there was just so much room to do that.” This again points to an implicit-explicit uptake of a character in that Kittya follows the plot arc of the show and stays as true to the show as possible, while still exploring a character who Kittya believes received little attention on the show. For each of these implicit-explicit uptakes, the authors reveal both their intimate knowledge of the text as well as their ability to more deeply analyze particular characters based on details from the show.</p>
         <p>Often implicit-explicit uptakes occur when a fanfic author is interested in learning more about a character, implicit-explicit uptakes also occur when an author makes assumptions about the original text’s universe or relationships between two characters based on details. Aria describes several choices she made in her fanfic based on assumptions from the show, such as how different cultures in TLOK understood gender and sexuality, a character probably not knowing how to cook, and another character being a “bourgeoisie radical.” Aria’s analysis of the different cultures in TLOK demonstrates both her knowledge of the show as well as an understanding of cultural difference.</p>
         <p>In reflecting on often used implicit-explicit uptakes in fandoms, several authors point to popular relationship pairings in fanfics as representative of fans reading the subtext of the original text. Valk, for example, wonders why there are not more Sansa/Margaery fics as their potential romance is “literally right here,” referring to the subtext of the show. Dialux also points to a potential romance between Jon and Sansa based on the trailer for GOT’s season six, when fans began speculating about Jon and Sansa’s relationship. Similarly, Gillywulf addresses the Korra/Asami fics written before the show confirmed their relationship was canonical. Specifically, Gillywulf points to a moment between Korra and Asami in the third season after Korra was injured. She says, “Asami looked the most scared out of everybody, and her reaction to her offer to stay with Korra through her recovery, and help any way she can was sort of, ‘That's a little gayer than it maybe should be,’ that sort of look. So, a lot of people took that and decided to go with it.” Gillywulf points to fans’ abilities to analyze the subtext and draw particular assumptions, then write fanfics about these assumptions. Based on simply Asami’s facial expression, Gillywulf and others performed implicit-explicit uptakes.</p>

            <h3>Quotes</h3>
            <ul>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I was under the impression, reading or engaging with this text, I came away with
                  this feeling like the Northern Water Tribe is somewhat... very different from the
                  rest of the world, and there are ways that it plays as... I don't know if it was textual
                  or sort of fan-driven more, but I remember coming away with this feeling that there
                  is a marginalized subjectivity in the Northern Water Tribe. And so telling this story
                  about difference in culture, and we'll get to... I'll get to Korra's upbringing a
                  little bit later, because you're going to ask about 10 minutes later about Korra's
                  upbringing. But I want to... Basically that I think Korra's upbringing is particularly
                  reflective of that culture, yeah.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I come away from Korra feeling like, "This is a gender thing going on." I don't buy
                  that there's not homophobia in a world with gender in the like weird way that... In
                  ways that still reflect our I think gender and homophobia [inaudible 00:21:13], the
                  way that we have a sense of gender. Big, capital G Gender. And so I thought like,
                  "What does it mean to have culture in the context of... What does it mean to be a
                  cosmopolitan city where... There's both a degree of marginalization for like the Northern
                  Water Tribe closing... Not so much that rules that are really intended to enforce
                  gender norms are going to be there. And also to be like, "Yeah, there's probably a
                  different understanding of gender in context," yeah.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Asami probably can't like cook...because I think it's either canonical or in fanon,
                  and I kind of like that, because I like the notion that... I like the notion that
                  someone who's very good at some things, but just not good at other things.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think that this is a piece that comes from a weird part of what I understood about
                  that world. To me, Korra grows up in a compound with people who are older than her,
                  who aren't likely to tell her the truth about things. Because the White Lotus is an
                  organization of people who are fundamentally keeping her apart. And I remember being
                  like, "Oh, these folks are not going to tell a child about queer sexuality." Particularly
                  sexuality is a hard topic, you grow up in that kind of compound in a world where queer
                  identities are looked down on, you're going to come away with this very strange view
                  about that. And you might just be told nothing.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Because I imagine Korra's pain is seeing the cost of her new trauma after time, because
                  her being injured, being in a place where you are tortured to death as a vulnerability.
                  Every time you experience that pain, I imagine that that's a place that engagement
                  is a struggle after time when you're in that pain. So it's an ordeal for Korra to
                  dress herself.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>In the context of this piece, a lot of my understanding of Hiroshi as a bourgeois
                  radical is that I'm not going to have a [inaudible 00:30:36], because I don't really
                  have a sense of class politics at the time, or have the beginnings of that study.
                  That's only beginning to be born</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also, if you're looking at a subtext, my people they were like, "Oh yeah, I want to
                  tell this story, I want to finish this story." And there's a degree to which it a
                  queer reading, there's this political tendency to look at fiction and say, "I am going
                  to tell the story you didn't." And so during the subtext period, you've already got
                  these people who are basically being like, "Yo, I'm going to tell this story.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
                  I obviously can't give an explanation for a lot of these. But I think that they
                  make sense, to a certain extent, because there definitely are a lot more
                  heterosexual relationships within this fandom than I've seen in a lot of other
                  fandoms. And I think that's probably because we don't have one
                  main character and one side character that's like the sidekick to the main
                  character, both of them being male. You don't have that here.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because
                  I know that a lot of people had mentioned that it was at the beginning of Season
                  Six. Like, when a couple of trailers came out regarding Sansa meeting up with
                  somebody in the North. It was kind of staging with Ramsay Bolton. That Jon Snow and
                  Sansa Stark fandom kind of really took off. And it was the beginning of Season Six
                  that it really, properly emerged. So, it would be interesting to see if there is a
                  cookie cutter point that you can identify like, this is where the general public
                  kind of suddenly said, "Oh, this is the moment."</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>The first being that we
                  only get a certain amount of them in canon.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>At the end of season three, we saw that development and
                  we saw, especially during Korra's fight with Zaheer, Asami looked the most scared
                  out of everybody, and her reaction to her offer to stay with Korra through her
                  recovery, and help any way she can was sort of, "That's a little gayer than it maybe
                  should be," that sort of look. So, a lot
                  of people took that and decided to go with it, especially since
                  the relationship was [inaudible 01:00:21], whether or not ...
                  Again, and at that time, we didn't know the writer's intention, so it was just
                  everybody, or at least Korrasami fans, picking
                  up on it and saying, "Okay, well, we don't know when season four is happening,
                  so we're just going to kick off from there and this is what could
                  happen."</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I kind of wanted to see that explored in my own way. And with Asami in particular,
                  and this was surprising for me because usually I'm all for the main character. I
                  never really remember to think about the other ... But with Asami, it felt like
                  there was this big gap available to us for exploration.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So I kind of wanted to explore that and see how
                  Asami herself was dealing with it. Because for me I like to see how the characters
                  are responding to what's happening to them rather than having the plot happen to
                  them, and with Asami there was just so much room to do that.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And also on being canon-compliant,
                  but still ... I was working in an area where there was nothing for canon yet. I'm
                  assuming that with the comics now, we'll get more information on that regard. But
                  at
                  the time, there was nothing in that area. So I wanted it to be known that it was
                  still within canon's bounds, but there were going to be things being explored that
                  weren't articulated in canon.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Whereas, for
                  Asami, Asami didn't have anyone, or at least maybe in her head she didn't have
                  anyone. So she went back to someone, I
                  guess who is an ... I wouldn't say an abuser because there isn't that dynamic
                  for them. But in the way that the relationship shifts from love and care to an
                  act of violence ... I don't know. I just wanted to explore
                  that. It's just fascinating to me to see how people who were deeply hurt somehow
                  still find a way to circle back around to the people who have hurt
                  them.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>You never
                  really hear about what Jaime thought about it. I sort of delved into this idea trying
                  to explore Jaime reacquainting himself
                  with these things later on in life, but through a modern lens because I also
                  wanted to be able to relate to it as well.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>from the source material where I wanted to kind of
                  explore Jaime's perspective on this, but through a modern lens and later on in life
                  because a lot of Jaime's self-realization in the book comes after he meets Brienne
                  as well.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I just find their relationship in
                  canon to be so interesting because it was one of
                  the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
                  pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
                  surprised.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>even in the context of like the canon,
                  he always had a very strange affinity, but
                  like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
                  loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point
                  of view.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think he definitely
                  is someone that would pick up on someone's interests and what not and what that
                  means to them, either subconsciously or consciously channel it when he's handling
                  it.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That's definitely
                  something that is taught in canon with him, in terms of never showing your full hand
                  of cards to the enemy, being deceitful and it's all to reach your goal. I think that
                  would still carry over to a modern setting, but it would be more toned down into a
                  more reasonable kind of thing like, "I don't want to seem like this is actually for
                  me. I'm buying it for someone else." If I don't want to get lambasted or judged or
                  anything like that. Residual toxic masculinity and
                  all of that.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I ship Sansa and Marjory and I tried to write fic for
                  them, but I
                  don't know why it never picked up. Marjory just walked around the whole show
                  just hitting on everyone. I was like why isn't there more of this? It's
                  literally right here.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was my take on the scene where Brienne and Pod meet her in the tavern, where
                  she seems to be at first a little surprised, a little relieved, and then you kind
                  of
                  see her shut down a bit.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But in my mind, I
                  didn't think she didn't want it because she didn't necessarily trust Brienne, it was
                  more because Peter would never let her go. Even if this person said, "I'm going to
                  help you," he would never allow that, because he
                  wants control of her, and that is something that she realizes, because she's not
                  an idiot. She's seen this man in King's Landing, she sees how
                  he operates. She sees how he operates in the Eyrie. If he doesn't have total control
                  of her, he's not going to allow it. And the best way to do that would be to get rid
                  of these two people. And she doesn't want anyone to die for her. So that was kind
                  of
                  my read on that situation.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So yeah, [Missandei]'s such an interesting character. There's
                  so much about her that could be written that isn't written. I just kind of wanted
                  to
                  investigate a little bit. What would life have been like for this character?</li>

         <h2>Uptake: Fan Practices</h2>
         <div class="interview-search-analysis">
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition</strong>: When fan authors discuss a fan practice uptake, which is when a fan takes up fan genre practices in the fan community, such as engaging with fan genre conventions or implementing specific tagging practices.</p>
            <p><strong>Number of Codes</strong>: 30</p>
            <p><strong>Analysis</strong>: When sharing fan practice uptakes, the fan author's point to larger conventions in fan communities that often occur across fandoms, such as similar practices in both GOT and TLOK fandoms. Of course, these conventions still engage with the original text, but these uptakes are specific to fan communities. Reading each fan authors’ transcripts show shared discourse, such as words like “fanon,” “shipping,” and “AU.” There is a specific, shared discourse when discussing and participating in generic conventions, tagging practices, and other fandom activities.</p>
            <p>First, each author reflects on particular fanfic generic forms that are mainly found in fan communities and known by members across these communities. Dialux’s fanfic is a great example. She wrote her fic based on a request from another fan. The fan wanted “historical AU, alternate universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending.” This stream of suggestions, which Dialux was able to accommodate, demonstrates shared discourse and an understanding of common fanfic generic conventions. Aria also points to the difference between fanfic generic conventions and “literary” genres; she says she used to label her pieces as angst or fluff, but recently began seeing her genre participation as separate from these fanfic genre conventions. Participating in and being able to recognize these generic forms demonstrates a shared fan practice; while fans engage and define these practices, they are enacting fan practice uptakes.</p>
            <p>Another form of fan practice uptakes are methods for discoverability and authors attempting to reach their audience, such as using hashtags or keywords depending on the platform. Since this project specifically looks at Archive of Our Own (AO3), the fan authors all discuss tagging practices on AO3. There are different author-selected categories for tagging, from the characters that appear in the author’s fanfic to additional tags the author can choose. Each of these tags can be used to search (include or exclude) while readers try to find their ideal fanfics. Tagging is a form of fan practices uptake in that authors need to know specific discourse and use this discourse to reach their audience. Kittya, for example, talks about how she did not understand tagging practices when she wrote her fanfic; she says, “ I wasn't quite sure what tags to use because I was still learning.” However, there is not one proper way to tag a fanfic. While there is a shared discourse, fans can also practice tagging in individual ways. As Gillywulf points out, some authors choose to write full sentences in the Additional Tags, rather than merely choosing a few key words that mirror fans’ shared discourse. While Gillywulf does not like to write sentence-long tags, this example demonstrates that there are particular expectations that fans often break or challenge in their uptake of fan practices.</p>
            <p>Understanding tagging as an uptake is important because the author is not only trying to originally reach their ideal audience, but their fanfic must follow through on the tag’s promise. If an author chooses the tag “Alternate Universe,” then their fic typically engages with AU generic conventions. Writegirl also signals how important tagging practices are, especially in the GOT fandom. She says some readers respond to the tags authors use and argue that they used incorrect tags; correcting authors’ tagging choices is another fan practices uptake. So not only are there expectations for particular discourse to be used when tagging, but the actual text must take up the tags’ promises and, if the text does not, readers may critique and potentially ostracize the author from the fandom.</p>
            <p>Another form of fan practice uptakes are fan-specific activities that occur in fan spaces. Dialux points to this in her motivation for writing fics. She participates in several fan community activities, such as the “Yuletide assignment” and the “Jonsa Exchange” (Jonsa is Jon/Sansa romantic fanfics). These activities vary based on the fandom, platform, and generic form. Often, though, they are large prompts that invite fans to create art, from illustrations or fanfics. The “Jonsa Exchange,” for example, pairs authors together and they request different types of fics; as I mentioned previously, Dialux wrote her fic for this exchange based on another fan’s prompt. To participate in these activities is a form of fan practice uptakes, as fans are literally taking up the assignments and creating another generic form in response.</p>
            <p>Another example of fan-specific uptakes are fan translations, as Kittya discusses. Fans translate particular texts, such as a show or novel for other fans to make the text accessible. Kitya used fan translations after she moved to North America and wanted to continue watching Hindi shows; she could not speak Hindi fluently, so she relied on these fan translations. Finally, fans often inspire each other through their art, and other fans will specifically take up their art. Gillywulf provides several examples of this. One fan artist drew several pictures based on Gillywulf’s fanfic; Gillywulf’s last chapter in her fanfic is inspired by another fan artists’ painting; and Gillywulf specifically mirrors writing practices one of her favorite fanfic authors utilizes in their fanfics. The creativity flourishing in fan communities demonstrates how fans take up fan generic conventions, inspiring and forming bonds with each other.</p>

            <h3>Quotes</h3>
            <ul>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>People are like, "Oh..." When people talk about RWBY, the way they talk about the
                  White Fang is the way they talk about radical politics. And I don't know if they realize
                  it, but I always get really annoyed, because this is like bad political theory. It's
                  very normal American political theory, but it's also bad. It's very much like, "Oh,
                  there's no justification for violence," it's like, "I don't agree."</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also I think it's when fiction ends, it does draw people who are like, "Oh, I want
                  to write more on this subject, I want to play with these concepts again." There's
                  also a distinct un-ended-ness</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think the redo of the relationship, the exploration is limited, is kind of bad.
                  But I also think that the way that we end somewhere where it's like, they just want
                  to be married, or at the end of their first date, we did see them agree, yeah I want
                  to do this. Yeah, I want to have this, or I like this, it's healthy. I love that!
                  I just see that as a lot of things for writers to engage with.[inaudible 00:47:08]
                  what are other ways we can imagine it?</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And that creates fanon, which means you get this whole long space of people being
                  like, "Oh yeah, I am writing about this content of fanon in this alternate universe,
                  I'm going to write a piece about a radio show</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It sort of leaves a lot of space for the development of [inaudible 00:47:39], some
                  of the Equalist Asami stuff, and some of the discussion that comes out of that. So
                  I think that's very, very fertile ground for fanfic, and I think that it's liberating
                  for a lot of folks. So it drives a lot of views.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And I don't know, I don't know if I'd use the fluff and angst tags anymore, just because
                  I don't talk about my literature in those terms as much anymore, as I used to, but...
                  Largely because nobody...You don't use those tags as much anymore in my view, like
                  we don't talk about... Those are very much Fanfiction.net-y terms that pulled over,
                  I don't see them as I used to.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong> a [inaudible 00:57:08] of the audience that come later are less interested in acknowledging
                  or talking about race. Given this is a proportion, I don't know if [inaudible 00:57:24]
                  but more people as a fandom and those few people aren't interested in talking about
                  race in ways that people who had been there before were, and those people who were
                  there before continued to talk about race, or if there is an effectively gentrifying
                  mmoment that a white fandom comes in, pushes out a fandom of color. I don't know how
                  this tag is used, so I would feel hesitant to say something definite. But I find that
                  a little bit troublesome.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>The context is basically just, yeah, things you would expect people would say on a
                  date, things you'd expect people to do on a date, things that writers do when they
                  run out of words, like chuckle.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Also this more mature understanding of a relationship, seeing their partner as a dork
                  versus like, seeing them as cute. And obviously you see your partner is cute for a
                  long time after you start dating, that... Viewing someone as a dork is a more developed
                  sense of what a relationship is.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But I've also recently published work in Fleabag, which
                  was one of the fandoms that I had to write for for my Yuletide assignment.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, when I wrote this fanfic it was actually one of
                  the... I had signed up for a fic exchange for this one, as well. It's called the
                  Jonsa Exchange. It was their fifth round. Their theme was, "Inspired by
                  film."</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, the
                  person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
                  universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that used second person point of
                  view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
                  you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
                  of
                  view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
                  what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
                  more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the reason I did the Jodhaa Akbar tag was actually
                  because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
                  other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
                  fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
                  particular tag.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's been
                  a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
                  always great. And I think the name was [inaudible 00:11:19]
                  at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
                  art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
                  it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
                  person's mind."</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I know a lot of people like to have full sentences, and
                  get really detailed and say things like that, but I always find that to be sort of
                  distracting, because I know, when I'm personally looking for something, I like to
                  be
                  able to just click through until I find exactly what I'm looking for. So, if
                  somebody has what I'm looking for, but also in that same tag is a full sentence of
                  something else, it doesn't necessarily help me stuff. If somebody's specifically
                  looking for, I guess a long-distance relationship thing, they can just click on that
                  and see, "Okay, well, it's in here somewhere. I'll just find whichever prompt it
                  is." I'm a big fan of just keeping things neat and simple.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
                  it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
                  since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
                  until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
                  a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
                  decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
                  this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
                  case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
                  Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
                  bit.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>It was
                  partially based on a drawing by [inaudible 00:50:02] that had
                  Korra and Asami sitting under a tree and just looking out over Republic City,</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's a writer, whose name I always mess up. I want to
                  say it's coeurdastronaute. They do a lot of Clarke and Lexa
                  stuff, but she sets the scene super well with like, "Here's the sky. Here's the
                  roads. Here's the this," and I tried to emulate that.</li>
               <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's okay to learn from other writers. Like I said
                  with coeurdastronaute, everything she writes is like, "I'm in
                  love with this. It's great. How can I maybe write something similar to that? What
                  parts can I take from this that I want to emulate?"</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I got into forums and fans would
                  translate for those of us who didn't speak Hindi. And obviously
                  people would answer questions if you asked because you couldn't get everything in
                  the translations or the summaries. And during that time, we would talk about the
                  plot of the show, what the characters were doing, where we were expecting things to
                  go at that time. It was just a lot of the basic things at fandom.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I guess you can say it was a
                  nudge to move from passive consumption to active consumption.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But also the fics I had read after the
                  show had finished seemed to focus primarily on how Korra was dealing with ...
                  Obviously, it was a really traumatic experience and so on in how she ... what had
                  happened in the gap years that they hadn't shown us for Korra.</li>
               <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Partly, I wasn't quite sure what tags to use
                  because I was still learning.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, definitely when it comes to trying to write it
                  realistically as well, but the banter back and forth was very difficult. I read a
                  lot of fanfic where it can be very stalkish and when I think about it and I think
                  about someone saying it out loud, I just like cringe. My face caves in.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think I would want to go
                  more into maybe tagging some of the triggers maybe now a days because back then
                  there wasn't as much of a discussion around it. Now a days, you have more of a
                  discussion around what bigger tags to put in to help people avoid it for instance.
                  Now that AO3 has updated its tagging system to include and exclude.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Sandor and Sansa, I will say that I like their ship name
                  as San-San. I do understand the whole
                  like rough, the woman that warms his heart thing. Again, it's all very like
                  romance novel-y prompts when I've tried to find fic and I'm just like, "I'll
                  just write a Nora Roberts novel." I'd so read her books if I
                  wanted to. I don't need to read them here.</li>
               <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I had some really bad, some
                  really heated discussions with a friend on my dashboard on Twitter. We just did that,
                  like Brienne was actually fully a lesbian
                  and that she hated people linking her with Jaime. And I'm like, "That's an
                  interesting concept, not canon, but concept." She was fighting people on the
                  dashboard about it with the sort of bigger, than someone who has like facts in
                  front of them would argue. And I'm like, "I understand, but this is your
                  interpretation." People who ship her with Jaime don't hate lesbians. Please, do
                  not try and put this away. Yeah, it was a whole mess. People
                  came out in droves, angry for different reasons.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then people would be like, "Oh, your fanfic is
                  this like this one, so why don't you go read this fanfic?" It kind of was a jumping
                  off point for me.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
                  delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
                  Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
                  away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
                  one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
                  fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
                  of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
                  if I was a former slave. The one thing I
                  would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
                  in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
                  into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
                  anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
                  like to see a bit more of that in <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> fanfiction. She's really an
                  underused character.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
                  thing I noticed about the <cite>Game of Thrones</cite> fandom, because I did just kind of jump
                  in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
                  and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
                  unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
                  me
                  try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
                  There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
                  improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>The
                  "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
                  People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
                  right there." So I had the "What if."</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Out of character? I
                  never know. I think my
                  characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
                  "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
                  it may be out of character."</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Alternate universe, canon
                  divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
                  want to get blasted on that one.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's one thing, to me, if it's too OOC, just out of
                  the block  there's no real change, and these drabbles are
                  so short. You can't really see a lot of character development from A to B.
                  Everything kind of has to fit where it does. So I wanted to make sure that it fit
                  and it wasn't too crazy. It's a lot of research.</li>
               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think it's the same with, I'm also very
                  active in the Star Wars fandom, and that's one thing you see in a lot of Star Wars,
                  especially the new trilogy. People love taking the characters out of where they are
                  and
                  putting them in today. That doesn't surprise me at all.</li>

              <h3>Quotes</h3>
              <ul>
                 <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't want to be like, "Ah, but I'm writing the version of this character that's
                    a woman." I hate that. I know that that's permissible with the meta text but I don't
                    want to be part of that.</li>
                 <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is I think the first piece where I write as a adult writer looking at the world
                    and going, "Okay, what do I actually think? What can I say about this that is interesting,"
                    instead of just being like, "I don't know, let's take a thought and just run with
                    it." I think that in a lot of ways it suffers of being really in that space, but it's
                    also a good piece in that I'm genuinely, actually doing literature, in a way that
                    I really was not before.</li>
                 <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love story
                    about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not make
                    those two pieces meld at the time. The story arcs just never came together, and I
                    couldn't harmonize them, and it sort of died because I couldn't get to the thing I
                    was trying to make, not ambition, but I couldn't make either one of them make sense.</li>
                 <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I guess the first three, they're basic tags. You want to read angst, here's angst.
                    You want to read fluff, well, this is fluff and angst. Well I'm not sure how fluffy
                    but...Do you want to read a romance? Here's a romance.</li>
                 <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And then the last one's a content warning, like yeah, if you read this you'll see
                    homophobia. I can't not publish a story about homophobia.</li>
                 <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I thought it was romantic. I don't remember why I did that, that's one of
                    the ones where just... I think it's part of I had that as sort of my first... It was
                    more like one of the most basic tools that I learned, so I learned, "All right, I'll
                    do alternate points of view."</li>
                 <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't know if I thought about this as a storytelling tool at times, or I thought
                    about it as a storytelling tool obviously that helps power [inaudible 00:17:00], not
                    necessarily about the story if it makes sense. I wasn't telling you things that had
                    happened in the past, to teach you what happened in the past. I was saying, "This
                    is what's haunting the characters, this is what the characters can't escape from in
                    a very physical, visceral fashion." Well maybe physical might be the wrong word, you
                    know what, I'm okay with it, body and mind, if it makes sense.</li>
                 <li><strong>Aria: </strong>If I remember correctly, this was about writing about suicide. I had been in a fight
                    for a very long time. And I was nearly constantly suicidal. And so writing this piece
                    was an engaging... It was obviously triggering.</li>
                 <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
                    love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
                    stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
                    of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
                    of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
                    "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
                    who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
                    of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
                 <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think that people writing about suffering and happiness, a lot of things happen
                    in love stories in general, particularly in WlW and MlM stuff. Well, I don't know
                    if MlM, I don't read it very much just because one, I am not a man, and two, so much
                    MlM stuff is kind of uncomfortable? A lot it's very clearly written by women.</li>
                 <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First guess is actually that there's a) an explosion of stories that aren't canon
                    compliant, so people are staying people are saying, "This story is canon compliant,"
                    as a way of engaging. In terms of, it makes sense to say something's canon-compliant
                    sort of at the end of the piece, because once the story is over then it makes sense
                    to go back and say, "actually this is canon compliant." A lot of stories before a
                    story ends it's already like, "How could this go from here?" And so I would imagine
                    that the canon compliance people were like, "Well, I'm telling this story based on
                    what literally happened," instead of all of these other tellings that I'm seeing now.
                    That would be my first guess. My second guess is that people are excited to tell stories
                    that were literally just after the end of The Legend of Korra</li>
                 <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And to be fair, omega and alpha as being there in the far right column. I don't really
                    understand ABO [alpha, beta, omega] as in general, so I can't talk. They're not as
                    inherently sexual. They definitely struck me as relatively sexual, and that's not</li>
                 <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But a few years later when I was, I think,
                    13, my friend introduced me to like crack Lord Of The Rings fiction.</li>
                 <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, the
                    person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
                    universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending.</li>
                 <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I chose to make it Desi because I am Desi. and I wanted
                    to experience it.</li>
                 <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I mean, I think the
                    choice to make Westeros Desi was more of, I don't want to do that much work in
                    setting up all of these tensions, and identifying them. And kind of building, and
                    trying to communicate that to the reader when there's already preexisting framework
                    for it.</li>
                 <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And it was football RPF
                    (real person fic) fanfiction. Which was very interesting, because I think it was
                    just after the 2018 World Cup.</li>
                 <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that used second person point of
                    view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
                    you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
                    of
                    view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
                    what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
                    more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person.</li>
                 <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yeah. I mean, I really do
                    feel like there aren't that many second person point of views that kind of allow you
                    to immerse yourself into that person, or into that character.</li>
                 <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was literally
                    just pulling things from here, and there. And, I mean, there's Rajput culture as well
                    as
                    South Indian culture, as well as there's some random, I think, there's some
                    Bengali culture that I just threw in for the hell of it.</li>
                 <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But when I was making the
                    actual list of material, I basically just ran through from top to bottom of the
                    actual fanfic. And basically tried to remember everything that I thought about. And
                    identified the particular things that I was thinking about and trying to
                    identify.</li>
                 <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But, yeah. I think just developing the list of material
                    and everything kind of helped me understand on a step by step process, everything
                    that I had kind of... The assumptions that I had made, and where I had taken certain
                    ideas from.</li>
                 <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Just building that list kind of helps me know where and how
                    I'm getting the material, and the assumptions that I've made throughout the fanfic.
                    And, therefore, helps make it easier to kind of discuss it later, I think.</li>
                 <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, obviously, race bending is, and can
                    be, very racist if not done in a very respectful manner.</li>
                 <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, that was one of the
                    primary reasons why I decided to make it in the first place. Because I wanted to be
                    sure why and where I was getting these ideas from.</li>
                 <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And it is an angsty fic. It's not like a comedy, there is angst.
                    And it's one of the major points of the entire fanfic.</li>
                 <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, this fic is obviously
                    dramatized and all that. But the essential part of it is that both of them have
                    this core feeling that they cannot get rid of,
                    that the world has done them a huge injustice. And as much as it's cathartic to
                    see that in fanfic, I also feel like if you go through life like that, it's a
                    very difficult way of going through life. And it's not
                    necessarily a happy life that you lead when you have that kind of a
                    mentality.</li>
                 <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then
                    the fact that the alternate universe for a modern setting is so
                    [inaudible 01:07:54]. Which, to me, is very interesting.
                    Because I tend to go out of my way to avoid modern alternate universes, because I
                    personally don't like them.</li>
                 <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, I think one of
                    the major ones is fluff.</li>
                 <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, you do
                    see a lot of angst, though.</li>
                 <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I didn't necessarily want to
                    do full-length fics. I sort of wanted to just spit them out, and then, it came to
                    a
                    point where I was like, "Okay, well, I don't want to have individual listings for
                    each of these," so I just put it all into one thing on AO3 and decided that, "Well,
                    all right, I'll just do the prompts as the chapter titles and just go until I
                    can't."</li>
                 <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, I think for
                    shorter things, there's a challenge in that you have, I think most of them ended up
                    being 200-400 words, so you have to do an entire story in that time. You have to
                    make somebody care about things that are happening in much fewer words, and make it
                    more impactful in less amount of time. If you have 10,000 words to set up a
                    situation and resolve it, and all that, it's definitely different from, "Here's just
                    basically a gut punch of a story, and you maybe don't get the whole thing."</li>
                 <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's a couple that, I don't
                    remember which ones, but there were a couple that I sort of left on a weird note
                    [inaudible 00:09:21] on purpose, so that it had to be
                    like, "Okay, well, maybe you want more, or maybe it's good as it is," and I liked
                    that.</li>
                 <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, my audience is pretty much just other fans like me, so it
                    was sort of just, "Well, what would I want to read? And what would people my age
                    think is fun?" Things like that. There were a couple people who regularly sent me
                    prompts, so it was sort of, I knew these were the sort of things they were into, or
                    I know what they're angling for in this question, in this idea. So, I'm like, "Okay,
                    I can sort of tailor it to that,"</li>
                 <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's been
                    a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
                    always great. And I think the name was [inaudible 00:11:19]
                    at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
                    art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
                    it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
                    person's mind."</li>
                 <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Even though it's 400 chapters, it's book-length. It's like a
                    normal book length. It's easily digestible, and each thing's its own thing, so if
                    you want to stop it and come back to it later, you can. People do usually, if you're
                    feeling a specific mood, and go find that specific one and just go through a couple
                    of those. I like that it's sort of, you don't have to have a super amount of
                    emotional investment in it, like super long, 10-chapter fics that are 100,000
                    words.</li>
                 <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Like yes, it's very good. I enjoy it. But sometimes, I'm just in
                    the mood for something light and I like that I can provide that for people who want
                    that.</li>
                 <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, the fact that
                    it was short meant that I did only have a certain amount of words to deal with
                    it.</li>
                 <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. Well, absolutely
                    part of it was wish fulfillment. I've never been in any sort of relationship, so it
                    was like, "Okay, this is might what it be like." But also, I'm a big fan of the fact
                    that, of using fanfiction, or TV shows, or movies, or any of that as escapism.
                    You look out your window and things are just not
                    good a lot of the time,
                    so I really like reading things that are just
                    soft and maybe things aren't so terrible for them where they are, and just sort
                    of getting lost in the idea of, they can just relax. They've been through so
                    much, they deserve a little bit of something that's not going to hurt them, with
                    somebody who definitely wants the same for them, who wants the same for
                    themselves. I tried to make that as a focus. Yeah, I just
                    really wanted that.</li>
                 <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
                    different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
                    know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
                    way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
                    So, I tried to mix it up on occasion.</li>
                 <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Even in the modern drabbles, or the
                    other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
                    she can access that.</li>
                 <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Things like that, you notice immediately, but also that
                    it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
                    I
                    don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
                    trying to get portrayed.</li>
                 <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I
                    try and put good outcomes for Korra, in that she's living the life that she wanted
                    to live with a person she loves, doing
                    something she loves. And even though it maybe needs to be a little bit more
                    complicated, because of hormones or things like that, but it's not a huge
                    obstacle, it's just a little something to add to the day. But
                    yeah, it's like the whole mood of most of the things I try and write. I want it to
                    be happy.</li>
                 <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And especially for this, it's not a
                    serious work, it's meant to be something fun, it's meant to be something that is
                    just for other people to enjoy. And I wouldn't be enjoying it if I was writing those
                    things that made me super uncomfortable.</li>
                 <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I wanted it to, like everything
                    else, just be soft and be a way of saying, this is their city, their lives are going
                    to go on, and they're going to be happy and enjoy it.</li>
                 <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, these big cartoons that are for kids are doing more
                    for those relationships than a lot of live-action things, because live action, you
                    kill people often, and brutally, so it's a lot easier to go, "Okay, cartoons are
                    much more gentle. Cartoons are easier to adjust."</li>
                 <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But
                    basically where you would participate with one fan writing a line, the next fan
                    writing another line and so on and so forth. So that was the first time that I
                    actually wrote anything fandom related.</li>
                 <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And then there was a bit of a lull until my delving into the
                    Indian forums. And there we would do the meta analysis and satirical writings and
                    so
                    on. </li>
                 <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Actually, I completely forgot, there was a
                    period where I would write like a satirical review of what was happening, because
                    I
                    don't do that anymore for anything really. But it was an opportunity to experiment
                    with writing and being critical of source materials and so on.</li>
                 <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I started writing and initially my own fanfic, so self insert fan
                    fic when I was like maybe about 10 years old.</li>
                 <li><strong>Valk: </strong>You never
                    really hear about what Jaime thought about it. I sort of delved into this idea trying
                    to explore Jaime reacquainting himself
                    with these things later on in life, but through a modern lens because I also
                    wanted to be able to relate to it as well.</li>
                 <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
                    Jaime and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
                    because obviously they wouldn't be having as
                    much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
                    considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
                    day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
                    from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
                    versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
                    wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
                    identity. But there would definitely be some push
                    back, but how would that change based on the setting?
                    I made her a little bit more comfortable in
                    her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
                    shoulder for Jaime
                    who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
                    well.</li>
                 <li><strong>Valk: </strong>from the source material where I wanted to kind of
                    explore Jaime's perspective on this, but through a modern lens and later on in life
                    because a lot of Jaime's self-realization in the book comes after he meets Brienne
                    as well.</li>
                 <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was part of
                    actually a larger, I guess, alternate universe idea that I had in mind explaining
                    how Jaime got to that point living with Brienne, where Brienne has been before and
                    how she had gotten to living with Jaime.</li>
                 <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think it's because he's used to having to perform any
                    way and being very new, if you're very new into
                    like trying to question your gender identity, especially being a man, you are at
                    a higher risk of...I should say more so, if you present male than you are at a
                    higher risk of facing violence or any kind of physical outlashing. Be it verbal
                    or physical, but I think it's a lot of like, you learn to be very secretive.
                    You'll act in ways to protect yourself, more than
                    anything.</li>
                 <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That's definitely
                    something that is taught in canon with him, in terms of never showing your full hand
                    of cards to the enemy, being deceitful and it's all to reach your goal. I think that
                    would still carry over to a modern setting, but it would be more toned down into a
                    more reasonable kind of thing like, "I don't want to seem like this is actually for
                    me. I'm buying it for someone else." If I don't want to get lambasted or judged or
                    anything like that. Residual toxic masculinity and
                    all of that.</li>
                 <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted
                    to still carry over the kind of relationship that Jaime and Tywin had in the TV show
                    in the medieval setting, but to modernize it more again, but not take away the fact
                    that Tywin was a very controlling father.</li>
                 <li><strong>Valk: </strong>trying to work through gender things. I
                    wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
                    their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
                    that would fit them better or explore better. I wanted to also
                    work through those emotions with me.</li>
                 <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I
                    guess I was thinking about also how I had reacted or how my friends had reacted
                    to when I came out to them.
                    I wanted to, I guess write a do-over for some
                    of them about how I would have liked to have that experience with me, like
                    having them knock again and come inside and ask questions and not just kind of
                    leave it right there and not talk again. I wanted to sort of console myself a
                    little bit through it as well as wanted to console Jaime</li>
                 <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of write it as like a self-fulfilling
                    fantasy as well as like how I would have pictured them actually going through
                    it.</li>
                 <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I learned how much writing a one shot sounds good and all in
                    practice, but then it ends up opening all these other doors of should I write more,
                    should I write less. I don't know what I should be doing with this.</li>
                 <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was
                    definitely a good writing practice for me also, in terms of knowing that I could go
                    back and explore myself with fan
                    fic if I needed to as well.</li>
                 <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Most Game of Thrones fanfic is incredibly hetero
                    normative and it's a lot of university AU, high school AU and
                    I'm like, "What about literally anything else?" I did a modern universe
                    [inaudible 00:37:49] Please, literally anything
                    else.</li>
                 <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And I actually really liked a
                    show called Xena: Warrior Princess. That was kind of my very first fandom. I really
                    liked, see I can't even remember now, Ares and Gabrielle. I wrote a fanfiction
                    about them that was set in modern times. That was my very first fan
                    fic.</li>
                 <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>X-Men comics. And I wrote a story, once
                    again, set in modern times. I kind of do this a lot. I take characters out of their
                    setting and transpose them into reality.</li>
                 <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
                    know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Doctor Who episodes is Turn Left.
                    And
                    it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
                    What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
                    And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
                    and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
                    the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
                    that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
                    world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
                    would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
                    maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
                    how I got into that.</li>
                 <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Let me just zero in on
                    the one moment that I think is pivotal, and just kind of get that out, and then
                    leave it alone. Because a lot of my drabbles, they are parts of much bigger fics.
                    I
                    just haven't posted them.</li>
                 <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That I've actually
                    written about 200 pages for. But that was just the one pivotal scene. So I was like,
                    okay, I'm just going to take you out and put you here, and then leave you
                    alone.</li>
                 <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>The
                    "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
                    People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
                    right there." So I had the "What if."</li>
                 <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Fix-it, cause they're mostly fix-it.</li>
                 <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Fluff and angst, I
                    cannot write straight fluff. I'm incapable. You have to have pain with your
                    pleasure. I can't do it.</li>
                 <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because it has to hurt
                    if it's to heal.</li>
                 <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
                    agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
                    dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
                    that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
                    Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
                    we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
                    that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
                    her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
                    supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
                    that.</li>
                 <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's one thing, to me, if it's too OOC, just out of
                    the block  there's no real change, and these drabbles are
                    so short. You can't really see a lot of character development from A to B.
                    Everything kind of has to fit where it does. So I wanted to make sure that it fit
                    and it wasn't too crazy. It's a lot of research.</li>
                 <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But I think people really enjoy the Jaime Lannister, Brienne of
                    Tarth is kind of like the person, your frenemy. The person you love to hate.
                    I would rescue you if you're falling off a cliff, but I'd probably punch you in the
                    stomach when I got you back on solid land for being in that position to begin
                    with.</li>
                 <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I like the modern setting. Modern setting seems to be the most
                    common one.</li>
                 <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think it's the same with, I'm also very
                    active in the Star Wars fandom, and that's one thing you see in a lot of Star Wars,
                    especially the new trilogy. People love taking the characters out of where they are
                    and
                    putting them in today. That doesn't surprise me at all.</li>
                 <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>canon divergence, angst, love, romance, smut. Not really. Everything seems to be kind
                    of
                    right where it should be, based on what I've seen. I'm trying to think of a tag that
                    may
                    be missing. No. Fluff, yeah, fluff's there, angst, romance. No, I think everything
                    is
                    there. You just randomly go on AO3, that's what you'd see.</li>

          <h2>Genre: Angst</h2>
          <div class="interview-search-analysis">
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Angst generic forms capture feelings of depression, anxiety, hurt/comfort, and other general forms of angst.</p>
          <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 7</p>
          <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Similar to the fluff generic form, angst is one of the more popular tags and recognizable genres by fans, as Aria suggests when she calls it a “basic tag.” Aria, Dialux, and Writegirl each share their experience and understanding of the angst generic form. Writing an angst genre usually means attempting to capture feelings of pain and sadness. Aria labels angst, along with fluff and romance, as popular fanfiction generic forms that other fans will recognize; she calls them “basic tags,” referring to the Additional Tags metadata authors can self-select on the fanfics they publish on AO3. Dialux also confirms this when she says, “You do see a lot of angst though.” Dialux continues to help define angst as a genre, explaining that angst as the opposite of comedy, which suggests authors who write in the angst genre rarely think about making their audience laugh. Finally, Writegirl hints at a potentially other important convention in the angst generic form: that there is always a form of relief, of healing, within the text.</p>

            <h3>Quotes</h3>
            <ul>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I guess the first three, they're basic tags. You want to read angst, here's angst.
                  You want to read fluff, well, this is fluff and angst. Well I'm not sure how fluffy
                  but...Do you want to read a romance? Here's a romance.</li>
               <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think that people writing about suffering and happiness, a lot of things happen
                  in love stories in general, particularly in WlW and MlM stuff. Well, I don't know
                  if MlM, I don't read it very much just because one, I am not a man, and two, so much
                  MlM stuff is kind of uncomfortable? A lot it's very clearly written by women.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And it is an angsty fic. It's not like a comedy, there is angst.
                  And it's one of the major points of the entire fanfic.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, this fic is obviously
                  dramatized and all that. But the essential part of it is that both of them have
                  this core feeling that they cannot get rid of,
                  that the world has done them a huge injustice. And as much as it's cathartic to
                  see that in fanfic, I also feel like if you go through life like that, it's a
                  very difficult way of going through life. And it's not
                  necessarily a happy life that you lead when you have that kind of a
                  mentality.</li>
               <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, you do

               <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Fluff and angst, I

                  pleasure. I can't do it.</li>

            <div class="interview-search-analysis">
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Fluff captures a happy, feel-good story, referred to as fluff because of the warm-and-fuzzy affect the writer attempts to capture. It almost always centers around romance and everyday moments of joy or cuteness.</p>
            <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 9</p>
            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Similar to the angst generic form, fluff is one of the more popular tags and recognizable genres by fans, as Aria suggests when she calls it a “basic tag.” Participating in the fluff genre means attempting to capture happiness in a text. describes fluff as a way for lesbian fanfic authors, especially, to speak back to a larger culture that often writers lesbian romances as tragedies. For Aria, she sees fluff as a popular tag in TLOK, specifically, because “women who love women...want to tell stories that have happy endings.”</p>
            <p>Gillywulf has a similar perspective, as her string of Korra/Asami vignette fanfics mostly fall within fluff genre conventions. Gillywulf explains her reasoning, “You look out your window and things are just not good a lot of the time, so I really like reading things that are just soft and maybe things aren't so terrible for them where they are.” Interestingly, while Aria and Gillywulf both wrote Korra/Asami fanfics and self-identified as lesbians, Writegirl — who identifies as demisexual — discusses being “incapable” of writing straight fluff. For her fanfics, most which do not revolve around romance, she wants to capture and include pain.</p>

               <h3>Quotes</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>So I guess the first three, they're basic tags. You want to read angst, here's angst.
                     You want to read fluff, well, this is fluff and angst. Well I'm not sure how fluffy
                     but...Do you want to read a romance? Here's a romance.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
                     love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
                     stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
                     of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
                     of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
                     "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
                     who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
                     of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, I think one of
                     the major ones is fluff.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Like yes, it's very good. I enjoy it. But sometimes, I'm just in
                     the mood for something light and I like that I can provide that for people who want
                     that.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. Well, absolutely
                     part of it was wish fulfillment. I've never been in any sort of relationship, so it
                     was like, "Okay, this is might what it be like." But also, I'm a big fan of the fact
                     that, of using fanfiction, or TV shows, or movies, or any of that as escapism.
                     You look out your window and things are just not
                     good a lot of the time,
                     so I really like reading things that are just
                     soft and maybe things aren't so terrible for them where they are, and just sort
                     of getting lost in the idea of, they can just relax. They've been through so
                     much, they deserve a little bit of something that's not going to hurt them, with
                     somebody who definitely wants the same for them, who wants the same for
                     themselves. I tried to make that as a focus. Yeah, I just
                     really wanted that.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I
                     try and put good outcomes for Korra, in that she's living the life that she wanted
                     to live with a person she loves, doing
                     something she loves. And even though it maybe needs to be a little bit more
                     complicated, because of hormones or things like that, but it's not a huge
                     obstacle, it's just a little something to add to the day. But
                     yeah, it's like the whole mood of most of the things I try and write. I want it to
                     be happy.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And especially for this, it's not a
                     serious work, it's meant to be something fun, it's meant to be something that is
                     just for other people to enjoy. And I wouldn't be enjoying it if I was writing those
                     things that made me super uncomfortable.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I wanted it to, like everything
                     else, just be soft and be a way of saying, this is their city, their lives are going
                     to go on, and they're going to be happy and enjoy it.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Fluff and angst, I
                     cannot write straight fluff. I'm incapable. You have to have pain with your
                     pleasure. I can't do it.</li>

          <h2>Genre: Vignette</h2>
          <div class="interview-search-analysis">
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p><strong>Definition:</strong> : Vignettes are intentionally shorter fanfics, such as 100 words to 1000 words, that capture an entire story in a small word count; 100 word fics are referred to as “drabbles.” Vignettes are more of a medium rather than a generic form — as they rely on a limited amount of written text to tell a story — so they may be multiple generic forms and conventions appearing across different vignettes.</p>
          <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 10</p>
          <p><strong>Analysis:</strong>  Only Gillywulf and Writegirl incorporated the medium of vignettes or drabbles in their fanfics. Gillywulf wrote a series of short vignettes based on prompts provided to her by her readers. Part of Gillywulf’s reasoning for choosing this medium was because she did not want to write a longer-length fic. She also, however, points out the challenge of writing vignettes because an author has “to make somebody care about things that are happening in much fewer words.” Another challenge of writing a series of vignettes, too, is that she did not want to make her fics repetitive, so she had to find creative methods for describing similar situations. Specifically, she reflects on writing about Korra and Asami meeting for the first time — she aimed to make each meeting special, to make what each character notices about each other unique, and to capture particular moods.</p>
         <p>Writegirl, similarly, writes a series of vignettes, each its own chapter, reimagining particular moments from GOT. However, unlike Gillywulf, she plans to use some of these vignettes into a much longer fanfic. Specifically, she has written almost 200 pages — not linearly — of this longer fanfic. She chose to write and post these vignettes, though, as she argues she published on AO3 “one moment that I think is pivotal.” Similarly to Gillywulf, she points to another challenge in writing vignettes: there is no time for character development, so she wanted to ensure her characters were not OOC — out of character — by conducting a lot of research on GOT. </p>

             <h3>Quotes</h3>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I didn't necessarily want to
                   do full-length fics. I sort of wanted to just spit them out, and then, it came to
                   a
                   point where I was like, "Okay, well, I don't want to have individual listings for
                   each of these," so I just put it all into one thing on AO3 and decided that, "Well,
                   all right, I'll just do the prompts as the chapter titles and just go until I
                   can't."</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, I think for
                   shorter things, there's a challenge in that you have, I think most of them ended up
                   being 200-400 words, so you have to do an entire story in that time. You have to
                   make somebody care about things that are happening in much fewer words, and make it
                   more impactful in less amount of time. If you have 10,000 words to set up a
                   situation and resolve it, and all that, it's definitely different from, "Here's just
                   basically a gut punch of a story, and you maybe don't get the whole thing."</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's a couple that, I don't
                   remember which ones, but there were a couple that I sort of left on a weird note
                   [inaudible 00:09:21] on purpose, so that it had to be
                   like, "Okay, well, maybe you want more, or maybe it's good as it is," and I liked
                   that.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Even though it's 400 chapters, it's book-length. It's like a
                   normal book length. It's easily digestible, and each thing's its own thing, so if
                   you want to stop it and come back to it later, you can. People do usually, if you're
                   feeling a specific mood, and go find that specific one and just go through a couple
                   of those. I like that it's sort of, you don't have to have a super amount of
                   emotional investment in it, like super long, 10-chapter fics that are 100,000
                   words.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, the fact that
                   it was short meant that I did only have a certain amount of words to deal with
                   it.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
                   different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
                   know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
                   way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
                   So, I tried to mix it up on occasion.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Things like that, you notice immediately, but also that
                   it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
                   I
                   don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
                   trying to get portrayed.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Let me just zero in on
                   the one moment that I think is pivotal, and just kind of get that out, and then
                   leave it alone. Because a lot of my drabbles, they are parts of much bigger fics.
                   I
                   just haven't posted them.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That I've actually
                   written about 200 pages for. But that was just the one pivotal scene. So I was like,
                   okay, I'm just going to take you out and put you here, and then leave you
                   alone.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's one thing, to me, if it's too OOC, just out of
                   the block  there's no real change, and these drabbles are
                   so short. You can't really see a lot of character development from A to B.
                   Everything kind of has to fit where it does. So I wanted to make sure that it fit
                   and it wasn't too crazy. It's a lot of research.</li>

          <div class="interview-search-analysis">
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Fix-it is usually a canon-resistant uptake and “fixes" something that happened in the canon, like a particular writing choice. These fics usually come out of disappointment from the canonical narrative arc.</p>
          <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 4</p>
          <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Fix-it fics are often created when the canon text did not go in the direction the fan author anticipated. The only fan author who explicitly labeled their fic as a “fix-it” fic is Writegirl. She uses the “fix-it” and “what if” additional tags to signal to her audience that her fanfic will be canon resistant. She points to two main reasons for writing fix-it fics: her unhappiness with some of the writing in the GOT show, and her desire to explore “what if” in context with the butterfly effect — or when one small change ripples across and drastically changes that timeline. Specifically, she points to the lack of agency the GOT show writers provided to Sansa, and she wants to “give her a little more agency.” Writegirl views the GOT show writing as inconsistent, and therefore she decides to reimagine particular moments that she believes the show’s writers could improve.</p>

             <h3>Quotes</h3>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
                   know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Doctor Who episodes is Turn Left.
                   And
                   it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
                   What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
                   And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
                   and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
                   the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
                   that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
                   world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
                   would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
                   maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
                   how I got into that.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>The
                   "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
                   People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
                   right there." So I had the "What if."</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Fix-it, cause they're mostly fix-it.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
                   agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
                   dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
                   that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
                   Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
                   we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
                   that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
                   her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
                   supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
                   that.</li>

          <h2>Genre: Author's Note</h2>
          <div class="interview-search-analysis">
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Authors’ notes appear at the beginning or end of fanfic chapters. The purposes of these notes are to provide content warnings, reflect on particular choices made in the fanfic, identify authors’ positionalities that relate to their fanfic, or speak back to readers or specific comments. For this code, I am also choosing to include supplemental, explanatory material written along with fanfics that may not just appear at the beginning or end of a fic.</p>
          <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 7</p>
          <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Only Aria and Dialux discuss including author’s notes or supplemental materials to be paired with their work. Aria discusses her author’s note as a space for content warning and self-reflection. Specifically, she uses content warnings, such as the mention of suicide, to practice care for her audience, as her writing may be triggering for some. She also uses the author’s note to reflect on her own mental health at the time and how writing this piece impacted her. </p>
         <p>Dialux does not discuss the traditional fanfic understanding of author’s notes -- the notes above or below specific chapters -- but instead shared the creation of supplemental materials to be read alongside her fanfic. Because her fanfic, which merges GOT with the Indian historical film <cite>Jodhaa Akbar</cite>, uses several cultural references to Rajput, Mughal, and other Indian ethnicities,  Dialux links to a list of notes and explanations that she created (<a href="https://dialux.tumblr.com/post/177407977570/and-we-can-see-the-future-notes">posted on her Tumblr</a>) after publishing her fanfic. She cites her motivation not as a guide for readers, but rather “because I wanted to be sure why and where I was getting these ideas from.” Her fanfic both discusses cultural differences in historic India as well as merges some cultural practices, so she decided to trace her choices and make explicit which cultures and traditions she pulled ideas from. She expresses surprise, though, when I mention I read her fanfic along with the supplemental materials to better understand her choices; she did not imagine anyone actually reading the supplemental list. Author’s notes are not only a fan authors’ way of engaging and reaching out to readers, but also a way for them to reflect on their own decisions and make explicit their writing process.</p>

             <ul>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And then the last one's a content warning, like yeah, if you read this you'll see
                   homophobia. I can't not publish a story about homophobia.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>If I remember correctly, this was about writing about suicide. I had been in a fight
                   for a very long time. And I was nearly constantly suicidal. And so writing this piece
                   was an engaging... It was obviously triggering.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was literally
                   just pulling things from here, and there. And, I mean, there's Rajput culture as well
                   as
                   South Indian culture, as well as there's some random, I think, there's some
                   Bengali culture that I just threw in for the hell of it.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But when I was making the
                   actual list of material, I basically just ran through from top to bottom of the
                   actual fanfic. And basically tried to remember everything that I thought about. And
                   identified the particular things that I was thinking about and trying to
                   identify.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But, yeah. I think just developing the list of material
                   and everything kind of helped me understand on a step by step process, everything
                   that I had kind of... The assumptions that I had made, and where I had taken certain
                   ideas from.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Just building that list kind of helps me know where and how
                   I'm getting the material, and the assumptions that I've made throughout the fanfic.
                   And, therefore, helps make it easier to kind of discuss it later, I think.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, that was one of the
                   primary reasons why I decided to make it in the first place. Because I wanted to be
                   sure why and where I was getting these ideas from.</li>

          <h2>Genre: Identity Bending</h2>
          <div class="interview-search-analysis">
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Identity-bending is when the fic writer transforms an aspect of a character's identity, such as their sexuality/race/gender, in their fic. Identity-bending is not necessarily a generic form, but rather a rhetorical choice made while participating in genres.</p>
          <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 10</p>
          <p><strong>Analysis:</strong>  Identity bending in fanfiction may take many shapes, as there are multiple modes of identity.  The main fan authors who implement identity-bending genres in their work are Dialux and Valk. Both authors share their motivation to engage with identity-bending conventions as wanting to represent themselves in the texts they love. Both authors also happen to be writing in the GOT universe, which is coded as White/European and heteronormative.</p>
          <p>Valk directly mentions part of their motivation in identity-bending was to “be able to relate” to their fic; they wrote this fic as a “self-fulfilling fantasy” after they struggled with their own gender expression and identity. In their fanfic, they reimagine Jaime exploring his gender expression in a modern setting. While their quote about desiring to relate to their fic is mainly in reference to the modern setting, Valk also suggests it is Jaime’s gender exploration that they focus on, as this is the main plot of their piece. What makes this choice an identity-bending generic form is bending Jaime’s gender. In the original text, Jaime seems to be portrayed as a cis male, while Valk reimagines him as not cis, potentially non-binary or genderqueer, in the early stages of “questioning his gender.”</p>
          <p>Another area of Valk’s choice for identity-bending is in reference to Brienne’s gender expression and identity. While Valk’s version of Brienne only hints at a queer gender identity, Valk writes Brienne as much more comfortable with her gender because she does not face ridicule for refusing to conform to gender expectations. For Valk, representing queer gender identities and the early stages of questioning was a method for them to fantasize and reimagine a safe space that they were not offered as they questioned their own gender.</p>
          <p>Dialux also identity-bends in her fanfic, but focuses on race and culture, rather than gender. She identity-bends the GOT characters and universe, reimagining them as Desi and living in historic India. She explains that there are parallels between the GOT universe and historic India, including cultural and regional differences in the North and South. Part of her motivation to make the characters Desi and reimagine a “Desi Westeros” is because “I chose to make it Desi because I am Desi.” She represents herself, her family, and her culture in her choices, celebrating her culture’s history and traditions.</p>
          <p>Dialux does, though, point to potential dangers when practicing identity-bending: “Because, obviously, race bending is, and can be, very racist if not done in a very respectful manner.” Race-bending is important for authors of color who often do not see their experiences and stories represented in popular culture. However, race-bending if not done carefully can also reinforce stereotypes and hurt the very communities and peoples the fics are representing. Dialux explains that, even though she is Desi, she was careful in her writing. She cites the potential to race-bend carelessly as a reason she was hesitant to originally publish the fanfic.  Identity bending is a crucial genre in fanfics, but must be done with care towards the identities being represented, even if you are bending identities to represent your own.</p>

             <ul>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't want to be like, "Ah, but I'm writing the version of this character that's
                   a woman." I hate that. I know that that's permissible with the meta text but I don't
                   want to be part of that.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I chose to make it Desi because I am Desi. and I wanted
                   to experience it.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I mean, I think the
                   choice to make Westeros Desi was more of, I don't want to do that much work in
                   setting up all of these tensions, and identifying them. And kind of building, and
                   trying to communicate that to the reader when there's already preexisting framework
                   for it.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, obviously, race bending is, and can
                   be, very racist if not done in a very respectful manner.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>You never
                   really hear about what Jaime thought about it. I sort of delved into this idea trying
                   to explore Jaime reacquainting himself
                   with these things later on in life, but through a modern lens because I also
                   wanted to be able to relate to it as well.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
                   Jaime and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
                   because obviously they wouldn't be having as
                   much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
                   considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
                   day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
                   from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
                   versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
                   wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
                   identity. But there would definitely be some push
                   back, but how would that change based on the setting?
                   I made her a little bit more comfortable in
                   her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
                   shoulder for Jaime
                   who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
                   well.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think it's because he's used to having to perform any
                   way and being very new, if you're very new into
                   like trying to question your gender identity, especially being a man, you are at
                   a higher risk of...I should say more so, if you present male than you are at a
                   higher risk of facing violence or any kind of physical outlashing. Be it verbal
                   or physical, but I think it's a lot of like, you learn to be very secretive.
                   You'll act in ways to protect yourself, more than
                   anything.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>trying to work through gender things. I
                   wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
                   their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
                   that would fit them better or explore better. I wanted to also
                   work through those emotions with me.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of write it as like a self-fulfilling
                   fantasy as well as like how I would have pictured them actually going through
                   it.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was
                   definitely a good writing practice for me also, in terms of knowing that I could go
                   back and explore myself with fan
                   fic if I needed to as well.</li>

          <h2>Genre: Modern Setting</h2>
          <div class="interview-search-analysis">
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Modern settings, a subgenre of alternate universes, are when fans reimagine characters from their canonical universe into the fans’ modern-day universe, such as high school, college, or a coffee shop.</p>
          <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 12</p>
          <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> While Valk is the only fan author who engaged with modern settings in their fanfic, both they and Writegirl discuss the modern setting generic form. Writegirl has written and read several modern setting fanfics across fandoms, like <cite>Xena: Warrior Princess</cite>, <cite>X-Men</cite>, GOT, and <cite>Star Wars</cite>. This demonstrates the shared discourse and genres across fandoms; modern setting, one of the more popular tags on AO3, is a generic form with which many fans engage.</p>
         <p>While Writegirl merely expresses that she and other fans enjoy modern settings, Valk provides a bit more insight as to why the modern setting generic form is appealing. Specifically, Valk cites wanting to see themselves in their fanfic and wanting to make the fic more relatable to their own experience. Valk also argues that most GOT modern setting fics are “incredibly heteronormative” and take place in high schools or similar locations; Valk decides to challenge this convention in modern setting genres by writing a queer, potentially platonic story about Jaime exploring his gender expression in both a makeup store and his own apartment. By participating in modern setting genres, fans can more accurately represent their own lived experiences. These experiences, as Valk’s critique suggests, are entangled in systems of power, such as heteronormativity. Fanfic authors can challenge these systems of power by participating in fan genres, but reimagining particular conventions to resist exclusionary ideologies.</p>

                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then
                   the fact that the alternate universe for a modern setting is so
                   [inaudible 01:07:54]. Which, to me, is very interesting.
                   Because I tend to go out of my way to avoid modern alternate universes, because I

                   well.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>from the source material where I wanted to kind of
                   explore Jaime's perspective on this, but through a modern lens and later on in life
                   because a lot of Jaime's self-realization in the book comes after he meets Brienne
                   as well.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was part of
                   actually a larger, I guess, alternate universe idea that I had in mind explaining
                   how Jaime got to that point living with Brienne, where Brienne has been before and
                   how she had gotten to living with Jaime.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That's definitely
                   something that is taught in canon with him, in terms of never showing your full hand
                   of cards to the enemy, being deceitful and it's all to reach your goal. I think that
                   would still carry over to a modern setting, but it would be more toned down into a
                   more reasonable kind of thing like, "I don't want to seem like this is actually for
                   me. I'm buying it for someone else." If I don't want to get lambasted or judged or
                   anything like that. Residual toxic masculinity and
                   all of that.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted
                   to still carry over the kind of relationship that Jaime and Tywin had in the TV show
                   in the medieval setting, but to modernize it more again, but not take away the fact
                   that Tywin was a very controlling father.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Most Game of Thrones fanfic is incredibly hetero
                   normative and it's a lot of university AU, high school AU and
                   I'm like, "What about literally anything else?" I did a modern universe
                   [inaudible 00:37:49] Please, literally anything
                   else.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And I actually really liked a
                   show called Xena: Warrior Princess. That was kind of my very first fandom. I really
                   liked, see I can't even remember now, Ares and Gabrielle. I wrote a fanfiction
                   about them that was set in modern times. That was my very first fan
                   fic.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>X-Men comics. And I wrote a story, once
                   again, set in modern times. I kind of do this a lot. I take characters out of their
                   setting and transpose them into reality.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I like the modern setting. Modern setting seems to be the most
                   common one.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think it's the same with, I'm also very
                   active in the Star Wars fandom, and that's one thing you see in a lot of Star Wars,
                   especially the new trilogy. People love taking the characters out of where they are
                   and
                   putting them in today. That doesn't surprise me at all.</li>

          <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Each fan author mentions different common fandom generic forms that they either incorporated in their fanfic, in other fanfics, or read. Each one of these generic forms or mediums have rich histories, conventions, and ideologies. This brief analysis, though, will just provide a basic definition and glimpse into them.</p>
         <p>Aria argues there are distinct fanfic and literary genres, although she does not go into further detail. She also mentions ABO, or alpha beta omega, which writers imagine characters in different power dynamics based on supernatural reasons; ABO is also known as the omegaverse. Dialux mentions crack -- or intentionally absurd fanfics -- and historical AUs, or historical alternate universes that incorporate history in some way. Gillywulf incorporates several genres in her fanfic collection of drabbles/vignettes and other fan mediums, such as fan art. Kittya Cullen mentions learning to be critical of the source materials through meta-analysis and satire. Valk brings up two other fan mediums: self-inserts and onesshots. Self-inserts are when authors either insert themself as a character in their fanfic or use second person so readers can envision themselves in the fanfic. One-shots are usually one-chapter fanfics in which the story begins and ends within that chapter.</p>

             <h3>Quotes</h3>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is I think the first piece where I write as a adult writer looking at the world
                   and going, "Okay, what do I actually think? What can I say about this that is interesting,"
                   instead of just being like, "I don't know, let's take a thought and just run with
                   it." I think that in a lot of ways it suffers of being really in that space, but it's
                   also a good piece in that I'm genuinely, actually doing literature, in a way that
                   I really was not before.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love story
                   about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not make
                   those two pieces meld at the time. The story arcs just never came together, and I
                   couldn't harmonize them, and it sort of died because I couldn't get to the thing I
                   was trying to make, not ambition, but I couldn't make either one of them make sense.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I thought it was romantic. I don't remember why I did that, that's one of
                   the ones where just... I think it's part of I had that as sort of my first... It was
                   more like one of the most basic tools that I learned, so I learned, "All right, I'll
                   do alternate points of view."</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't know if I thought about this as a storytelling tool at times, or I thought
                   about it as a storytelling tool obviously that helps power [inaudible 00:17:00], not
                   necessarily about the story if it makes sense. I wasn't telling you things that had
                   happened in the past, to teach you what happened in the past. I was saying, "This
                   is what's haunting the characters, this is what the characters can't escape from in
                   a very physical, visceral fashion." Well maybe physical might be the wrong word, you
                   know what, I'm okay with it, body and mind, if it makes sense.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First guess is actually that there's a) an explosion of stories that aren't canon
                   compliant, so people are staying people are saying, "This story is canon compliant,"
                   as a way of engaging. In terms of, it makes sense to say something's canon-compliant
                   sort of at the end of the piece, because once the story is over then it makes sense
                   to go back and say, "actually this is canon compliant." A lot of stories before a
                   story ends it's already like, "How could this go from here?" And so I would imagine
                   that the canon compliance people were like, "Well, I'm telling this story based on
                   what literally happened," instead of all of these other tellings that I'm seeing now.
                   That would be my first guess. My second guess is that people are excited to tell stories
                   that were literally just after the end of The Legend of Korra</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And to be fair, omega and alpha as being there in the far right column. I don't really
                   understand ABO [alpha, beta, omega] as in general, so I can't talk. They're not as
                   inherently sexual. They definitely struck me as relatively sexual, and that's not</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But a few years later when I was, I think,
                   13, my friend introduced me to like crack Lord Of The Rings fiction.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, the
                   person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
                   universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And it was football RPF
                   (real person fic) fanfiction. Which was very interesting, because I think it was
                   just after the 2018 World Cup.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that used second person point of
                   view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
                   you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
                   of
                   view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
                   what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
                   more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yeah. I mean, I really do
                   feel like there aren't that many second person point of views that kind of allow you
                   to immerse yourself into that person, or into that character.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, my audience is pretty much just other fans like me, so it
                   was sort of just, "Well, what would I want to read? And what would people my age
                   think is fun?" Things like that. There were a couple people who regularly sent me
                   prompts, so it was sort of, I knew these were the sort of things they were into, or
                   I know what they're angling for in this question, in this idea. So, I'm like, "Okay,
                   I can sort of tailor it to that,"</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's been
                   a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
                   always great. And I think the name was [inaudible 00:11:19]
                   at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
                   art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
                   it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
                   person's mind."</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Even in the modern drabbles, or the
                   other AU, I tried to keep that as something that, that's what she is, whether or not
                   she can access that.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, these big cartoons that are for kids are doing more
                   for those relationships than a lot of live-action things, because live action, you
                   kill people often, and brutally, so it's a lot easier to go, "Okay, cartoons are
                   much more gentle. Cartoons are easier to adjust."</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But
                   basically where you would participate with one fan writing a line, the next fan
                   writing another line and so on and so forth. So that was the first time that I
                   actually wrote anything fandom related.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And then there was a bit of a lull until my delving into the
                   Indian forums. And there we would do the meta analysis and satirical writings and
                   so
                   on. </li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Actually, I completely forgot, there was a
                   period where I would write like a satirical review of what was happening, because
                   I
                   don't do that anymore for anything really. But it was an opportunity to experiment
                   with writing and being critical of source materials and so on.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I started writing and initially my own fanfic, so self insert fan
                   fic when I was like maybe about 10 years old.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I
                   guess I was thinking about also how I had reacted or how my friends had reacted
                   to when I came out to them.
                   I wanted to, I guess write a do-over for some
                   of them about how I would have liked to have that experience with me, like
                   having them knock again and come inside and ask questions and not just kind of
                   leave it right there and not talk again. I wanted to sort of console myself a
                   little bit through it as well as wanted to console Jaime</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I learned how much writing a one shot sounds good and all in
                   practice, but then it ends up opening all these other doors of should I write more,
                   should I write less. I don't know what I should be doing with this.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because it has to hurt
                   if it's to heal.</li>

           <h3>Quotes</h3>
           <ul>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Some of the pieces I wrote just no longer work as Homestuck pieces because the characters
                 have been changed, and I was like, "I can't really write this story about two women
                 in love because one of them isn't a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>When I'm writing this fic it means something, because I'm like... There's a study
                 I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about things you don't
                 convince them, but if you tell stories you can. And I think that I'm in that place,
                 arguing about politics in the fiction space of the internet.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I wrote a piece called Addict's Alchemy, which was a piece about...in terms of
                 servicing some of the same things we're talking about today. It's a piece about about
                 trauma... And it [inaudible 00:05:20], that this isn't obviously. It's a piece about
                 trauma and it's a piece about, what does it mean... Really they're both pieces about
                 what it means to be disabled.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
                 context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
                 very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
                 you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
                 original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
                 through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
                 and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
                 with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
                 get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
                 you.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was coming into my own politically, I was becoming my own political individual in
                 a way I hadn't been before. Like I had politics, but this is around the time that
                 I'm really radicalized, and just me engaging with those contexts.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is I think the first piece where I write as a adult writer looking at the world
                 and going, "Okay, what do I actually think? What can I say about this that is interesting,"
                 instead of just being like, "I don't know, let's take a thought and just run with
                 it." I think that in a lot of ways it suffers of being really in that space, but it's
                 also a good piece in that I'm genuinely, actually doing literature, in a way that
                 I really was not before.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First of all I wrote about suicide at a time where I was not ready to talk about it,
                 as a writer. I'm still not sure I can actually talk about suicide now, in a way that's
                 beneficial or useful for me. I'm not sure now I can do that now, or could not do it
                 now, but I could not do it at the time, or I couldn't do it in a way that was healthy.
                 I know I wrote it that it would seem therapeutic, but I also was being retraumatized,
                 and I didn't say that obviously in the tags.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so
                 I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And
                 already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They
                 weren't things I was writing about at the time.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love story
                 about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not make
                 those two pieces meld at the time. The story arcs just never came together, and I
                 couldn't harmonize them, and it sort of died because I couldn't get to the thing I
                 was trying to make, not ambition, but I couldn't make either one of them make sense.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I did consult with some folks when I was writing some texts about trauma, because
                 I was like... I wasn't comfortable writing that.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But that was the biggest bit of feedback I got was this conversation, and it helped
                 a little bit.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And then the last one's a content warning, like yeah, if you read this you'll see
                 homophobia. I can't not publish a story about homophobia.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters.
                 I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short,
                 but it felt more like a nod than a full</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong> There are things I don't like about it, but I like it as a little bit of text. It's
                 there in the text, it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love
                 feeling represented." So I wrote that.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
                 a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
                 different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
                 in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
                 and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
                 looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I thought it was romantic. I don't remember why I did that, that's one of
                 the ones where just... I think it's part of I had that as sort of my first... It was
                 more like one of the most basic tools that I learned, so I learned, "All right, I'll
                 do alternate points of view."</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>but this is what I was doing with my life. I was on my way to running a queer resource
                 center at a college, so I was doing the work of feeling the political implications
                 of things in the world. And so I was, for me the most natural thing to write about
                 is to write about... Not just homophobia, although this was a story about homophobia,
                 not just homophobia, but this was a story about queerness and politics. And because
                 this was the thing that was radicalizing me, [inaudible] is vile, because... And it
                 was about violence, so I don't just mean violence as a method of resistance, I mean
                 violence as a thing that people survive. Because that's what's radicalizing me at
                 the time. And so I felt the need to wake up that in a sense.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I was just engaging with the text's portrayal of trauma.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't know if I thought about this as a storytelling tool at times, or I thought
                 about it as a storytelling tool obviously that helps power [inaudible 00:17:00], not
                 necessarily about the story if it makes sense. I wasn't telling you things that had
                 happened in the past, to teach you what happened in the past. I was saying, "This
                 is what's haunting the characters, this is what the characters can't escape from in
                 a very physical, visceral fashion." Well maybe physical might be the wrong word, you
                 know what, I'm okay with it, body and mind, if it makes sense.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It was a piece that was sufficiently about me that it would have been fun and helpful
                 for a lot of people. But this, I think it was a good piece, it was a piece that was
                 a whole other world to read</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think of a place I was there, and this was particularly...I was engaging with political
                 institutions at the time that were much, much bigger than me, particularly family
                 institutions. My family was pretty chill, but running a queer resource center at community
                 college is like, getting that [inaudible 00:24:12]. You would deal with a bunch of
                 people that were writing about the problems for being gay, or feeling like they can't
                 talk about it, or being the only source of information, of being part of an institution
                 that was the only source of information.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was trying to write a story that engaged with trauma and felt authentic and didn't
                 make trauma seem like the end of the world. Because the binary that's in a lot of
                 literature is either like, "Oh, you either overcame trauma, or you are doomed to misery
                 forever." And I was trying to find some middle ground, trying to tell a story that
                 felt authentic.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Because I imagine Korra's pain is seeing the cost of her new trauma after time, because
                 her being injured, being in a place where you are tortured to death as a vulnerability.
                 Every time you experience that pain, I imagine that that's a place that engagement
                 is a struggle after time when you're in that pain. So it's an ordeal for Korra to
                 dress herself.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wanted to tell a story about connection. And I wanted to make it clear that when
                 I'm telling the story, I think that even [inaudible 00:26:39] understands that it's
                 not really about romance as much as it is about feeling connected in a genuine way
                 to people, that that central theme, building a life worth living after injury, or
                 after trauma, is finding an authentic realtionship with people.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And so Asami plays that role, being a person to whom Korra wants to relate, is thrilled
                 to relate, is not scared, or she is a little bit scared to relate, but is she scared
                 to relate in the way that she's scared to relate to other people.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Whereas Korra grows up in this institution, Asami grows up with a relatively politically
                 progressive father. He's an abuser, but he's also a very, very politically progressive
                 man. He's a radical, he tries to overthrow his government, make the world a more equitable
                 and fair place. It's self-interested, he's a bourgeois radical, but I wouldn't have
                 said that at the time. I imagine Asami as having a relatively normal, relatively healthy
                 understanding of the world in a way, having felt like she, not just knowing that a
                 woman can love another woman, because I guess almost every person in this world knows.
                 This is nothing like, Korra is particularly going to have a hard time because of that
                 institution itself.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>In the context of this piece, a lot of my understanding of Hiroshi as a bourgeois
                 radical is that I'm not going to have a [inaudible 00:30:36], because I don't really
                 have a sense of class politics at the time, or have the beginnings of that study.
                 That's only beginning to be born</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wanted to give a sense of what is the politics of the Northern Water Tribe? And
                 I kind of wanted to say that queerness isn't criminalized in the Northern Water Tribe,
                 or is not criminalized anymore. Also I wanted to say this is a different relationship.
                 But the other thing I wanted to talk about is, what are politicians willing to give
                 up for their family, and what are they not?</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>He's not particularly flawed, because he's willing to play this opportunistic political
                 game. Because he's also capable of looking at his child and going, "Maybe I shouldn't
                 do that." </li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I would also say a little bit about some of the research I'd read at the time, turns
                 out the book I was reading at the time that claimed that knowing someone who was gay
                 had a significant...Or not knowing someone who was gay, but engaging with someone
                 who's gay on the topic of being gay helped significantly with changing someone's political
                 views, or being willing to accept gay people. Turns out that one was actually wrong,
                 like literally the person who put together that study cooked the book.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I also sort of wanted to talk... I sort of was thinking about the limits of the political
                 and the [inaudible 00:35:57] of the political. You could do what, when and where,
                 the idea that a politician can't really save the world. I don't know if I was all
                 the way to, "We have to do it," yet, but I think I'm getting there.</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was thinking about New York City around the times of the Stonewall Riots. This is
                 where those politics come in. I was playing with, what does it mean... I was playing
                 with, what's particularly violent political oppression? What are the limits of political
                 oppression in a relatively liberal cosmopolitan society? Because I was getting that
                 sense of, there's actually a whole lot of ways that political oppression can happen
                 that I'd never even thought about at this point, and I was learning about that. So
                 I was writing about this character as someone who's experiencing the limits of that
                 political oppression. And this is actually one of the key storylines in my opinion,
                 and it's ultimately a story about resistance to a kind of political oppression</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This was written obviously before Donald Trump becomes President, and I could see
                 all sorts of things about reaction again. But I was seeing the reaction, I was scared.
                 I don't know where I got this, there was something bad was coming. I knew that I had
                 that sense of fear, so I was writing about... I guess writing a little bit about,
                 how do we fight back when things get worse?</li>
              <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I also learned that you have to be careful with how much to take on, and you have
                 to be careful about what you're willing to prune, and you have to be ready to prune
                 things. And you have to be ready to follow a story where it goes instead of trying
                 to follow all the directions you ever imagined. Because if you try to follow a story
                 in every direction you have, then it's going to die like this piece did. It's like,
                 "I don't know how to integrate the story into itself anymore."</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I had a very close group of friends on Live Journal back
                 in the early 2000s. That, I think, probably because I was a teenager. Perhaps this
                 is because of all those reasons. But that kind of close-knittedness has never kind
                 of shown up for me ever since. I think I tend to participate now on more, "Oh, this
                 is really interesting for me. And this is really fascinating." And I'll go into it
                 for the material as opposed to the friendships themselves.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Mostly to keep
                 myself writing. Because, otherwise, I would just not publish those materials until
                 it becomes, you know. It's basically sitting on my hard drive for years and years
                 on
                 end, and finally I get the opportunity and the motivation to publish them.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because,
                 initially, it was definitely a very close-knit, just writing for friends and with
                 friends.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But I've also recently published work in Fleabag, which
                 was one of the fandoms that I had to write for for my Yuletide assignment.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>There's a couple of things that you see that are kind of
                 interesting, and then you kind of identify a certain actor, or a certain character
                 that you kind of find interesting. And then jump from there to another.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yes. I think my most recent published fanfiction is a
                 Percy Weasley, second person point of view, post canon. In which he is attempting
                 to
                 basically restructure his society by running on a platform of big structural change.
                 Which might sound vaguely familiar.  But it was, I
                 think, mostly due to the kind of deep rage that I was feeling over the entire
                 Democratic Primaries over the past couple of months. And almost the past year.
                 In which everything felt very much like a lot of talk, and not a lot of doing.
                 And at some point, you need some catharsis. And kind of putting it out into
                 fiction and seeing something changing. Or, not even seeing something changing.
                 But seeing people trying to effect change, and willing to fight for that change
                 felt very important to me. And basically that entire fanfic is kind of born out
                 of that seething, massive, "I want to see something happening."
                 And I will see it happen in fiction, if not in reality.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>was talking about that, and I felt like
                 that was a really fascinating look into that psyche. And seeing how Fleabag and the
                 Priest would meet up. And how they would be after having separated for 20, 30 years,
                 coming back to see each other after they have had full lives apart, but somehow
                 still wanting something more. Which, I think, it's definitely, kind of, for me, I
                 am
                 not old enough to be discussing 50 year old, 60 year old life plans. But my life
                 path has never been very straight, or what I felt that it would be. Because when I
                 was, what? 15, I probably thought I'd be an engineer. And then after that I thought
                 I'd be a doctor. And then, suddenly, now I'm a lawyer. And I thought I'd be in the
                 U.S., and I'm in India. And it's a very wildly divergent and strange life path for
                 me. And that's only been over, what? 10 years, 10, 15 years. And I can't even
                 imagine how that would be over 20, 30 years. And identifying that desire for home,
                 and wanting people to be that. As opposed to a given area, or a given job, or
                 anything like that, felt very poignant to me at that particular point in
                 time.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, that was one fic that I was relatively and very
                 proud of. To be honest.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, when I wrote this fanfic it was actually one of
                 the... I had signed up for a fic exchange for this one, as well. It's called the
                 Jonsa Exchange. It was their fifth round. Their theme was, "Inspired by
                 film."</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, the
                 person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
                 universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And if you're just starting from scratch, then it's
                 difficult to create why two people would hate each other so much. I mean, you need
                 to have that religious, and
                 cultural, and those barriers in order for that to
                 happen.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I mean, I think the
                 choice to make Westeros Desi was more of, I don't want to do that much work in
                 setting up all of these tensions, and identifying them. And kind of building, and
                 trying to communicate that to the reader when there's already preexisting framework
                 for it.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that used second person point of
                 view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
                 you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
                 of
                 view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
                 what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
                 more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And that also came across to a lot of readers, is what
                 they were telling me, at least. Because they felt like there was a lot more gravitas
                 to the entire fic that you wouldn't see in a lot of my other
                 fanfics.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think that for
                 the actual research it was not so much that I did it for this particular fanfic, as
                 it was more that I love that era a lot. So, I had tended to research it before, as
                 well. So, I had a lot of information that I kind of knew in colloquial terms.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But I did
                 not remember the exact way that he had died, so then I kind of went searching for
                 that. And then, I mean, from there it kind of spiraled into researching other things
                 and kind of reading up more about Akbar and more about Jodhaa. And I'm an avid
                 research. I mean, that's what I do now.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Where I
                 just didn't translate them into Rajput or Hindi words. Because I just use
                 whatever I knew, because I speak Kannada at home. And that's
                 another language entirely. And I was just running out of time, and I said, "You know
                 what? No, I'll just handle it myself. And not translate it, and hope that nobody
                 minds.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think a lot of the research and a lot of the material
                 was just about identifying and pulling disparate ideas together that I knew.
                 From either my own culture because, of course,
                 this is partially my own culture. And also, the historical
                 details of [inaudible 00:27:49].</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I think that was what
                 was very important to me, especially in this story, was puling it all together so
                 that there weren't any open endings. And the research really, somehow, it helped in
                 pulling that together.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because I honestly expected nobody to do
                 that. It's good to see that people are just as interested in a lot of it, in this
                 stuff. You know?</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think that the
                 thing I wanted to keep in mind was that I was doing the research, but I was also not
                 putting as much research into it as I probably should have if I wanted to make it
                 historical fiction.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was literally
                 just pulling things from here, and there. And, I mean, there's Rajput culture as well
                 as
                 South Indian culture, as well as there's some random, I think, there's some
                 Bengali culture that I just threw in for the hell of it.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And that was one thing I wanted to be clear about.
                 Because, yes, it was research. But I think I wanted to keep to the spirit of the
                 movie, as well as the spirit of the A Song of Ice and Fire canon.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But when I was making the
                 actual list of material, I basically just ran through from top to bottom of the
                 actual fanfic. And basically tried to remember everything that I thought about. And
                 identified the particular things that I was thinking about and trying to
                 identify.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But, yeah. I think just developing the list of material
                 and everything kind of helped me understand on a step by step process, everything
                 that I had kind of... The assumptions that I had made, and where I had taken certain
                 ideas from.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was really worried about how it
                 would be perceived by the fandom, how it would be received by people even outside
                 of
                 the fandom.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, that was one of the
                 primary reasons why I decided to make it in the first place. Because I wanted to be
                 sure why and where I was getting these ideas from.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was
                 really worried about it, actually. Because I spoke to a couple people before I
                 published the fanfic. Because I was kind of worried about it, and I wasn't sure how
                 it would be received.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I wasn't sure people would
                 think that it was good enough. Because I was also combining both South Indian and
                 North Indian tropes, to a
                 certain extent. And those weren't necessarily very compatible. And there's a lot
                 of history behind that and everything. And I wasn't entirely
                 sure how people would perceive it.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But people were very kind about it. And I haven't
                 actually gotten a single negative feedback on that fanfic to date.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And
                 especially when she has that fight with Jon and she goes back home. And that was,
                 I
                 think, the point of catharsis. Because especially when you're looking at a lot of
                 Indian mothers, and Indian
                 women who get into marriages at a very young age. You have to deal with your
                 husband's family, you have to deal with that entire kind of stigma. About you
                 have to be the one to adjust and to compromise to a far greater extent than your
                 husband. And all of these kind of had come together and had
                 been marinating for a very long time. And I feel like Sansa, in this, was very much
                 the product of that. Where she was
                 just trying to fight it, she was such a perfect child in that culture. And then
                 suddenly she has to kind of leave her culture behind. Or, not leave her culture
                 behind, but adjust to a new culture. And she feels like she's
                 being punished by her old one for no fault of her own. And all of it, kind of, her
                 desperate unhappiness, her tensions with her mother were a big part of the fic, I
                 think, for me.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong> And I was so
                 worried. Because all of this was very close to my heart, and I did not want to have
                 to deal with a lot of backlash, or feedback, or having to fight to say, "Well, I
                 don't mean to be rude on any of these kinds of things." These are meant with respect
                 and they're meant with love. And they're from a part of myself.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, with all of that in mind, the actual fandom
                 response was absolutely wonderful, and absolutely, completely respectful. And none
                 of my fears at all came to fruition.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because they were all so kind, and so respectful of the entire fic in
                 general.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because that's what I keep feeling whenever I look back at
                 it, was how I got almost consumed by the characters when I was writing them.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I
                 didn't feel like I could end it with, "Oh, everybody has kids and they're all
                 happy." Because that felt very weird, and kind of disjointed with the rest of the
                 fic.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And
                 in that Sansa can see ghosts. And throughout the entire fic, it's a long fic and
                 everything, but one of the biggest issues for me was, how do I end this?</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But to me, it felt like it began with Jon and
                 it had to end with Jon. And it had to end with him finally being triumphant, and
                 finally being happy for his triumph at the end of this fanfic.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I initially wanted to make sure that it was pretty
                 clear to everyone that this was a canon divergence. Where one where Rhaegar has won,
                 Jon is raised a Targaryen.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the reason I did the Jodhaa Akbar tag was actually
                 because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
                 other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
                 fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
                 particular tag.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But then the cultural tensions stem almost entirely
                 from the differences within their upbringing, I'm pretty sure. Within their
                 families. And I mean, there are
                 cultural differences within, I mean, people that I've grown up with in India,
                 and people in the U.S. And even though you're living side by side, that doesn't
                 necessarily mean that you have the same cultural background.
                 And I think that's something that both of them don't understand. And both of them
                 kind of try to understand slowly.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And if you're talking about other moments,
                 like when Sansa wants to give Jon his name, and he asks her to read it out loud. I
                 think that's another moment of compromise. Because as much as she's giving him the
                 gift,
                 she's also giving him his name. And she's stepping across her own cultural
                 boundaries to help him with that, which Jon doesn't completely
                 understand.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Especially the quote that you put up here,
                 which refers to Sansa's eyes. Because that was a moment for me, I think, more than
                 anything else.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
                 that was something that even when you agree to a marriage, and even when you kind
                 of
                 accept that. Especially when you go into your husband's house, and if you're living
                 with his parents and everything. It's a very difficult concept. And it's a very
                 difficult idea. And adjusting to that
                 is a huge, almost, culture shock to people.
                 To any women, adjusting to that is
                 difficult. No matter who it is, no matter where you're going.
                 So, then, I mean, especially for Sansa, who needs to leave behind her entire family.
                 And doesn't even know when she'll be able to go back. And has to go to a foreign country
                 without any
                 support, and any of her own traditions. She's the one that's upheld every single
                 tradition she has ever done. And especially when you're looking at the Hindu
                 culture, it's very difficult to uphold them.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then, finally, she
                 slowly starts to grow into that. She starts to give moments of peace. You know,
                 she's kind of giving Jon gifts, and she's trying to bridge that gap. Because she
                 also realizes that it's her life, too. Which, I think, is one of the biggest
                 realizations that a lot of women have. Which is, "Yes, I'm miserable. I want you to
                 be miserable. But how am I going
                 to be miserable for?" You need to let some things go, you need to move on past
                 the injustices... I need to move past the injustices that I have
                 faced.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>The one quote that you picked out here, "You stand before your father, bedecked in
                 gossamer and lace and silk, glass thick and shining in your hair." Because that was
                 one that I actually remember. Because I initially put the word jewel, and jewels in
                 the place of the word glass. But then I wanted it, for her, to feel that it was
                 cheaper than the jewel. Even if she had them, they didn't matter to her. Because it
                 was just glass.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>As if, her family... Or, she's feeling as if her family is not willing to give
                 her as much as she is owed when she's going into a
                 marriage.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Oh. I think I learned that people are far more
                 understanding than I was giving them credit for, especially because I was so afraid
                 about the reception.</li>
              <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But then, I also think that one of the major
                 things that I learned was probably that some of the anger, it doesn't have to be a
                 very you anger to be a very deep one. For it to seep into your writing. Because a
                 lot of the time, especially when I'm writing angry stories and everything, they tend
                 to be immediate. Like, "Okay, I'm very angry right now. And I want to have a fit.
                 And I want to do it." But this was something that it had kind have been, I think,
                 brewing for a very long time. And then suddenly the anger, and the angst, and the
                 hurt, and the pain, all kind of came out. But at the same time, it was not just
                 that. It was also about passing through that anger, and knowing that there is going
                 to be someone at the end of it who's willing to accept you.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I hate that I did it, but I did real-person
                 fanfiction for Paramore. Thinking of it now, it's always like, "God, that's not
                 good. I shouldn't have done it, but here we are."</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
                 very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
                 queer
                 characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
                 go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
                 their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
                 situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I'm
                 trying to write something that's original, and that's always a bit more of an
                 endeavor than you expect it to be.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, it was definitely, when I first started it, it
                 was, "Okay, well, I kind of just want to write, and I want to get better at writing,
                 practicing it." I started it in college, and the professor I had at that time kept
                 saying how, "If you want to get better at writing, you have to write 50,000 words,
                 and then, you have to write another 50,000." "Really? All right. I'll just write,
                 then. People will give me prompts and I'll just write those as they come in." And
                 then, there were a lot of prompts that came in, surprisingly. I was able to stay
                 consistent with it for, I want to say, two, three years.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's funny, going back to the original ones, the
                 older ones at least, and reading those, because you sent me one. I think it was
                 chapter 37 you mentioned in your email, and I went back and read it and I was like,
                 "Oof, I could do this a lot better now, I hope."</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. Just, I wanted to get better at it, and people
                 were really good at giving me things that I could easily do at work,</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I didn't necessarily want to
                 do full-length fics. I sort of wanted to just spit them out, and then, it came to
                 a
                 point where I was like, "Okay, well, I don't want to have individual listings for
                 each of these," so I just put it all into one thing on AO3 and decided that, "Well,
                 all right, I'll just do the prompts as the chapter titles and just go until I
                 can't."</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's a couple that, I don't
                 remember which ones, but there were a couple that I sort of left on a weird note
                 [inaudible 00:09:21] on purpose, so that it had to be
                 like, "Okay, well, maybe you want more, or maybe it's good as it is," and I liked
                 that.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, my audience is pretty much just other fans like me, so it
                 was sort of just, "Well, what would I want to read? And what would people my age
                 think is fun?" Things like that. There were a couple people who regularly sent me
                 prompts, so it was sort of, I knew these were the sort of things they were into, or
                 I know what they're angling for in this question, in this idea. So, I'm like, "Okay,
                 I can sort of tailor it to that,"</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's been
                 a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
                 always great. And I think the name was [inaudible 00:11:19]
                 at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
                 art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
                 it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
                 person's mind."</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I like that a lot of people, I still get comments
                 occasionally that are, "I've just gone through this whole thing," and you can do
                 that.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I also like that you can sort of see a progression of
                 how I wrote them and how my own skills have maybe, hopefully developed. And even
                 just, it did end up being four years' worth of time</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>so it was, when I think I started it, Korrasami hadn't
                 been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
                 And maybe, I think,
                 during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
                 different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
                 strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, if there were some things where I'd write the
                 original drabble, and then I might get three more immediate requests in my inbox for
                 a sequel, or for, "Can I get a full length thing of this?" And I didn't necessarily
                 have the time or energy, or just the inclination in some cases.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, I would start to feel guilty, and sometimes
                 would just push one out whether or not I felt it was up to par, even though I hoped
                 it was.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I mean, most
                 of it was positive, which was really good. If somebody really didn't like something,
                 they didn't usually tell me. Or if they did, sometimes it was like a spelling error
                 or a formatting error, and it'd be, "Okay, I can just easily fix that." I don't
                 think there were too many outright negative things. There was one. I don't think it
                 was on a prompt, but this artist I really liked at the time commented and said
                 something like, "This would've been better with this movie instead of the one you
                 actually used," and didn't necessarily anything positive otherwise. I don't know if
                 they actually liked it, or if it was just sort of a, "Well, I would've liked it
                 better if you'd done this thing the way I wanted you to." Which, it is what it is,
                 and you sort of have to just say, "Okay, well, this is the way I did it, and I'm not
                 going to change it." But it was definitely a situation where I was like, "Okay.
                 Don't know what to make of that."</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Most of the time, people are very, very happy about
                 it, because it was just another thing for them to read.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, I'm
                 very much a person who believes in, if you can't say it in like two words
                 then you probably shouldn't. So, I like to have it, what
                 is this thing? And that's it. I like to be able to say, "This is what it's going to
                 be," and it doesn't necessarily need to be more complicated than that.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I know a lot of people like to have full sentences, and
                 get really detailed and say things like that, but I always find that to be sort of
                 distracting, because I know, when I'm personally looking for something, I like to
                 be
                 able to just click through until I find exactly what I'm looking for. So, if
                 somebody has what I'm looking for, but also in that same tag is a full sentence of
                 something else, it doesn't necessarily help me stuff. If somebody's specifically
                 looking for, I guess a long-distance relationship thing, they can just click on that
                 and see, "Okay, well, it's in here somewhere. I'll just find whichever prompt it
                 is." I'm a big fan of just keeping things neat and simple.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
                 different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
                 know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
                 way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
                 So, I tried to mix it up on occasion.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And
                 okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
                 notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
                 figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
                 she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
                 Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes. So, those
                 things stand out immediately.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Things like that, you notice immediately, but also that
                 it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
                 I
                 don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
                 trying to get portrayed.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>The first being that we
                 only get a certain amount of them in canon.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
                 it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
                 since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
                 until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
                 a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
                 decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
                 this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
                 case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
                 Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
                 bit.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, for that chapter, I want to say, like everything
                 else in the collection, it was a prompt, but it was something that I didn't want to
                 ham-fist it, because Korra's definitely, she's
                 traumatized. We see that more than once,</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> So, in this one in particular, she's trying to have a good experience and maybe power
                 through it, but then, in that brief lapse where she forgets that she's tied down
                 and then she tries to sit up, it's sort of like a muscle memory thing, where
                 she's back there the last time she was chained up and couldn't
                 move. But also, at the same time, I wanted Asami to immediately
                 be there and to be immediately helpful and not push her. She was just trying to be
                 comforting. You hear stories about how people
                 try and be helpful and just make situations worse, but at this
                 point in their relationship, Korra and Asami knew each other super well, and even
                 though this is an unusual situation for them, Asami knows how Korra reacts and knows
                 who she is and what she's thinking. She's able to help her come back slowly, rather
                 than try and make it a quick thing.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, I think I'd notice, not spacing errors, pacing
                 errors in that, I could've slowed that down a bit, I could've drawn the reader in
                 a
                 little bit more, just things like that, where it's just like, "I maybe know how to
                 write now," so it hopefully could've made it a little bit more
                 engaging.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, again, it was the prompts, but it was
                 also, I have personally been a little conflicted on gender for a while, and it's
                 like my sexuality, it was something that I sort of just say, "Well, I'll get to
                 that when I have the chance." So, it's always just sort of in
                 the back of my head</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I
                 try and put good outcomes for Korra, in that she's living the life that she wanted
                 to live with a person she loves, doing
                 something she loves. And even though it maybe needs to be a little bit more
                 complicated, because of hormones or things like that, but it's not a huge
                 obstacle, it's just a little something to add to the day. But
                 yeah, it's like the whole mood of most of the things I try and write. I want it to
                 be happy.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And even though the trans experience is not necessarily one
                 that I know for certain, there's plenty of people in the Korra community, in
                 most online Internet communities, where there's plenty of those people and you
                 see what they're going through and you see how their lives are,
                 and I try not to speak for situations that I've never lived through, but you can
                 draw knowledge from that and say, "Okay, well, without going in depth into feelings
                 or things like that, I can add this, this, and this, and make it maybe relatable in
                 that regard."</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And especially for this, it's not a
                 serious work, it's meant to be something fun, it's meant to be something that is
                 just for other people to enjoy. And I wouldn't be enjoying it if I was writing those
                 things that made me super uncomfortable.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's also, given the
                 audience, this is considered a family show. So, I realized over time that maybe I
                 don't have to write that.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
                 it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
                 press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" Because I just find keeping people as
                 slaves is super ... I didn't want to
                 contribute to it, and it was just that sort of idea
                 [inaudible 00:47:42] maybe are younger and a little bit
                 more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
                 been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
                 thing.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>even
                 though I will always love Korra and Asami, it's not necessarily always easy to write
                 for that, if you're not getting constant updates for it.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>It was
                 partially based on a drawing by [inaudible 00:50:02] that had
                 Korra and Asami sitting under a tree and just looking out over Republic City,</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I wanted it to, like everything
                 else, just be soft and be a way of saying, this is their city, their lives are going
                 to go on, and they're going to be happy and enjoy it.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And I also wanted to give the collection itself a
                 sendoff I was proud of. So, I spent a little bit more time on that than I did a lot
                 of the other stuff, just let it marinate. "You know what? This is a good end, and
                 hope you enjoyed," sort of thing.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So now,
                 I sort of write when I want to, when I have the motivation. And if I'm feeling it,
                 yeah, I'll do a little bit. Like somebody requested a prompt two weeks ago. I was
                 like, "You know what? Why not. I'm feeling it. We're going to go for it."</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I learned to just not push it,
                 don't write what other people are demanding, necessarily.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>My audience should be myself, at the end of the day. I
                 want to write the things that I want to read. Even if I'd much rather prefer just
                 reading it and not having to put the time and effort into clacking my way through
                 it, if I want to read it, I have to write it sometimes, which is fine. But I should
                 enjoy the things that I'm writing.</li>
              <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's okay that maybe only three other people
                 also liked it, but I like it.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think I started writing
                 fan fiction in earnest because I was homesick. Because I had recently moved, and so
                 it was with the intent of writing something that was close to home but also part of
                 fandom that I started doing that.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But I
                 think with Twilight it was just that phase where you finally find a
                 story that speaks to you, even if you kind of hate it when you look back at it when
                 you're older. But at the time, how
                 Bella was written both as someone who was insular and chooses to form or has a
                 small community and so forth and deals with depression or
                 whatever it is, it just seemed to be something that I could relate to. And so
                 I was both interested in that, and I guess in the power fantasy that she was written
                 to
                 come in to. Usually, at least for me at the time, it wasn't really common to see those
                 characters have that kind of a glow-up, you can say.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
                 was on Twitter casually scrolling through something, and someone from back home
                 happened to mention how the finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background
                 and
                 the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
                 that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
                 Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
                 I
                 could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
                 been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
                 how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I kind of wanted to see that explored in my own way. And with Asami in particular,
                 and this was surprising for me because usually I'm all for the main character. I
                 never really remember to think about the other ... But with Asami, it felt like
                 there was this big gap available to us for exploration.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So I kind of wanted to explore that and see how
                 Asami herself was dealing with it. Because for me I like to see how the characters
                 are responding to what's happening to them rather than having the plot happen to
                 them, and with Asami there was just so much room to do that.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>For
                 this particular fic, I think it was just the imagery. I was really trying to grasp
                 something that in some ways is so intangible. I was trying so hard to get just that
                 feeling of desolation and aching.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But the metaphor itself of the Marching Ants, it was
                 this way of articulating the anxiety that comes along with that.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I think it
                 just came back to capturing that, the imagery of it, the tone of the chapter, the
                 voice of it because, at least to me, it works really hard to put us in Asami's shoes
                 and make us experience it exactly as she's experiencing it.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>
                 And in terms of relationships and love and so forth, it was I guess just coming back
                 to what I like to explore in fiction, which is how people are interacting with each
                 other, what it means for them. And especially for certain characters who are ... I'm
                 not sure how I'm thinking of this, but I think what I'm thinking of is where the
                 audience may usually dismiss them or not consider them worthy of further
                 exploration. So I like to see for myself how their worth is existing within these
                 relationships, what it means for them and what it can mean for the audience and so
                 forth.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I guess the sensation of ants ... I come from an area
                 where you commonly come into contact with animals and so on, so I'm familiar with
                 the actual physical reality of ants crawling across your skin, and there's a way
                 that it feels. It's like a sort of weird, prickling sensation that is very
                 disconcerting, and I guess I wanted to translate that into how the story reflects
                 Asami's own experience with whatever she's feeling. And that imagery just seemed to
                 click with that, just the experience of having something under your skin and on your
                 skin, even if you can't quite articulate what it is.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With the case of Asami and her father, I think it just
                 came back to how they wrote the final book for the series. I found it fascinating
                 that Asami had reached out to her father after what had happened.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Whereas, for
                 Asami, Asami didn't have anyone, or at least maybe in her head she didn't have
                 anyone. So she went back to someone, I
                 guess who is an ... I wouldn't say an abuser because there isn't that dynamic
                 for them. But in the way that the relationship shifts from love and care to an
                 act of violence ... I don't know. I just wanted to explore
                 that. It's just fascinating to me to see how people who were deeply hurt somehow
                 still find a way to circle back around to the people who have hurt
                 them.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
                 think I was both going for an understanding of how Asami herself is effected by this
                 really terrible thing we see happen to Korra.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It's just to be someone who builds and creates
                 with the purpose of fixing or making better, but then not being able to do so for
                 someone within your personal life. But the imagery also for that chapter was, I guess,
                 built in subtext because I wasn't
                 quite sure yet how to engage with what was happening in ways that were visible
                 to other people outside of the fan community, the slashfan
                 community.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> It has less to do with fandom
                 itself and more to do with the external world. And even now it's, I guess it's ...
                 I
                 don't know. I think it
                 just seemed like the safer option at the time.  But the more
                 time I've spent in that part of fandom, the less I guess I've cared about how it's
                 read or whatever it is. But at the time, it just seemed wiser, particularly if I was
                 having others who may not ... Because fan works and original work for me are on the
                 same level, and so I'm not concerned, I guess, with people reading it for ... people
                 reading it and not seeing a difference in quality, but rather how they experience
                 the content. And so I think I was still considering who the audience would
                 be.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So both as a black person and as a woman, it was
                 just important for me to recognize that in text and get around to exploring what
                 that might have meant for other characters who weren't within the Circle of the
                 Avatar and had powerful connections.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Because there is this thing in fanfiction where we
                 assume that all people who are accessing it are familiar with the text. And while
                 that is often common when we want it to function beyond that world to have relevance
                 in other ways, I think for me personally it's important to integrate more parts of
                 the world, of the universe.</li>
              <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>For me, it was just reminding myself that, even though I'm
                 writing something where there are people who are familiar with the text, it's also
                 important to fill in the blanks sometimes.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Of course, being
                 younger, you don't really understand romance all
                 typically well. It's all very idealized. Then as I got older, I
                 started liking to delve more into different types of friendships as well.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I'm non-binary, so a lot of my work as I got older started
                 to deal more with gender as well as sexuality, also being
                 bi-sexual. I used it sort of as a tool in some fanfics to work
                 through ideas or feelings that I'd had and didn't know how to properly verbalize
                 yet. I was putting them on paper, using another
                 character as the medium and expressing or exploring different ideas in an area
                 where I felt I was kind of safe to do so. I didn't always
                 publish all of them, but the one that you contacted me over, I did,
                 obviously.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, I wrote it in
                 one sitting in a Starbucks near my university.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was around the
                 time when I was questioning whether or not I was non-binary and
                 I tried to sort of work things out with Jaime as the main focal character</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
                 Jaime and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
                 because obviously they wouldn't be having as
                 much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
                 considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
                 day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
                 from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
                 versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
                 wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
                 identity. But there would definitely be some push
                 back, but how would that change based on the setting?
                 I made her a little bit more comfortable in
                 her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
                 shoulder for Jaime
                 who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
                 well.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>writing it also based off
                 of my own experiences, just exploring the LGBT
                 community in my area, I was kind of writing it from that
                 perspective, but also not having as much information as I would like. </li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That, and also trying to write
                 and finish an entire fanfic in one sitting is very difficult when it's in a public
                 setting. Luckily, it happened and it was a nice exercise as well, just also to be
                 able to sit and write and have it really done in one sitting and then put it out
                 there was very satisfying.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I did a very brief
                 look over and then I was like, "Screw it,"</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, I got a very
                 interesting response from someone. I believe, maybe a week or two after. They were
                 like, "It's a really well written fanfic, it's great, but why in God's (capital G)
                 name, did you make Jaime like this?" And the moment I saw capital G, I was like I
                 see. I tried to be as cordial as I could and I explained what I said earlier about
                 my inspiration</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, that was the one big kick
                 back I got from someone. I was a little bit shocked that I got the capital G person,
                 but what can you do?</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>While I do ship them together romantically, I
                 wanted to write something that also reflected that you could do like a very intimate
                 moment without bring sex into it as well.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It's
                 something that I wanted to, again, wanted to bring into a fanfic to kind of make it
                 more relatable to me, but also to other people who might be reading this and
                 wondering the same thing.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>There's a lot of, again, fanfic already out there of
                 them being intimate, but it was all
                 very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
                 vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
                 I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
                 own instead.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I guess I wanted to
                 get a very powerful moment on paper. I had all these ideas and notes about what was
                 also going on in the universe and what not, but this was the one that kind of
                 started it. I wanted to make sure that I could get it down and not have it be that
                 fanfic that I write in my head and then I just cannot put on paper later on.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I really wanted
                 to address the gender issue and the gender questioning and write how the
                 experiences hit the hardest for me when I was thinking about
                 it. Definitely.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think he definitely
                 is someone that would pick up on someone's interests and what not and what that
                 means to them, either subconsciously or consciously channel it when he's handling
                 it.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think it's because he's used to having to perform any
                 way and being very new, if you're very new into
                 like trying to question your gender identity, especially being a man, you are at
                 a higher risk of...I should say more so, if you present male than you are at a
                 higher risk of facing violence or any kind of physical outlashing. Be it verbal
                 or physical, but I think it's a lot of like, you learn to be very secretive.
                 You'll act in ways to protect yourself, more than
                 anything.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, so at the
                 same time I was writing this fanfic, I was writing another one that kind of delved
                 into the timeline of how Jaime grew up.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It went
                 into his relationship with his father, he was caught walking in his mother's red
                 heels and he got very scolded and punished for it.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>This is a topic
                 that I was a little bit hesitant to tackle because at the time, when I was writing,
                 I wasn't very well-versed in
                 not just having a limb missing as a disability, but also how advanced the
                 prosthetics were and if they could hold things. I did a little
                 bit of research while I was at Starbucks, trying to sort of complete
                 everything.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>If I were to do this fic over again or
                 update it or add on to it, I would definitely
                 want to go more into his disability as well as his prosthetic and how it worked
                 more. Things like that to sort of flush it out more because I
                 don't think in the fic I didn't do the best job I could at it. It was sort of
                 something I tried to fill out as much as I could in the fic, but I probably could
                 have done better.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>trying to work through gender things. I
                 wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
                 their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
                 that would fit them better or explore better. I wanted to also
                 work through those emotions with me.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>The first big one
                 is never write an entire fanfic in Starbucks.</li>
              <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was
                 definitely a good writing practice for me also, in terms of knowing that I could go
                 back and explore myself with fan
                 fic if I needed to as well.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then that's when I kind of got feedback, because the
                 first fanfic, I never got any feedback from anyone. I was just like, "Oh, I'm
                 shouting into the dark." So yeah, it kind of changed, and it got me a bit more
                 active, and like, people actually want to say something about it. What did you think
                 about it? I started getting a bit more communication, a bit more activity.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And someone wrote a really detailed review, just about
                 how, I remember they said they could taste the road dust from my writing. And I was
                 like, wow. I never thought of it that way. That's really cool. That kind of inspired
                 me to write more, that I could get that emotion out of somebody. They felt like they
                 were actually there with them.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
                 Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
                 Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
                 no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
                 brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
                 thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
                 wrote a Game of Thrones fanfiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
                 series, the first one.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
                 know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Doctor Who episodes is Turn Left.
                 And
                 it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
                 What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
                 And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
                 and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
                 the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
                 that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
                 world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
                 would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
                 maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
                 how I got into that.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because I'm
                 a length whore. That's the problem. I get into these fics, and I have these ideas,
                 and then they expand out of control, and then I get into a story that's suddenly 30
                 chapters long, and then I run out of steam. I'm one of those authors who does kind
                 of get bored, and then starts cheating on my fic, which is happening right now in
                 Game of Thrones.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That I've actually
                 written about 200 pages for. But that was just the one pivotal scene. So I was like,
                 okay, I'm just going to take you out and put you here, and then leave you
                 alone.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's not done. It's not a solid 200 pages. I'm a very
                 chaotic writer, so I will get a bit of dialog in my head. I will see something, and
                 I will kind of write around that, and build around that, and string a bunch of
                 scenes. It's 200 pages, but it's 200 pages of broken up paragraphs, bits of dialog,
                 bits of scenery. So if I ever fleshed it out, it would be much longer, because I
                 have a problem containing myself.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I've had a
                 couple requests from the other ones. They're like, "I would love to read this
                 story." I'm like, "No, you don't understand. It's a lot to wade
                 through."</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think the strength is, I do try and keep it as much as
                 I can in character, and in situ, I guess. I don't like to pull too much of other
                 outside influences in. I think the strength is that people can read it and they can
                 really see it sliding into canon. And if you go into something aside, you don't have
                 to bump too much. And it would fit in the overall narrative.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I have a very hard time
                 getting into certain characters' heads, and seeing like, okay, is this the
                 motivation that they would have? Because I do take that very seriously. So, there
                 are times I'm just like, I can't see this person doing this. I can't see them doing
                 that. How do I get this to fit in with their character and not make it too over the
                 top, or too OOC? That's one of my main challenges.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I chose Sansa in particular, and I
                 think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
                 little bit of character assassination.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted to kind of show a Sansa who was still herself.
                 A Sansa who was willing to not listen to him, who
                 understood that, this person is not my friend. This person is strictly
                 manipulative. He's going to take me somewhere that I don't want to go, so my
                 only choice is to find the strength in me that she has, and say, "Okay, I'll
                 run. If it means I have to die, I'm not going to let him use me for whatever his
                 ends are." That's kind of where that idea came from.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She was
                 supposed to kind of get lost in the trees, and they were supposed to find her. But
                 I
                 thought that was a little bit ignominious for her. So then I remembered, Oh,
                 Nimeria's wolf pack. I was like, they haven't used that in the show at all, so why
                 not?</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's actually a lot more of that fic that is written
                 that didn't make it in. A whole thing where you get it from Nimeria's point of view
                 where you can see her. She's like, okay, just following to see what's going to
                 happen. And then when Sansa decides to run, that's when she decides to attack. But
                 I
                 thought that was a bit superfluous, so I took all of that out.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
                 of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
                 That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
                 delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
                 Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
                 away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
                 one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
                 fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
                 of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
                 if I was a former slave. The one thing I
                 would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
                 in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
                 into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
                 anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
                 like to see a bit more of that in Game of Thrones fanfiction. She's really an
                 underused character.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
                 thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
                 in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
                 and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
                 unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
                 me
                 try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
                 There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
                 improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>The
                 "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
                 People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
                 right there." So I had the "What if."</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Tags are hard because they are, it takes me...
                 The hardest part of my posting is tagging, to make sure that I have everything
                 right.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Ratings may change, warnings may change, series,
                 spoilers, all those kind of speak for themselves, just to let you know that okay,
                 once again, this isn't static. This is something that changes story by story. Some
                 of them may be Gen, some of them, I haven't written one yet, but some of them may
                 be
                 adult in the future. Some of them may have a lot of violence in them, so just be
                 aware. Don't ever come back to this fic and think, "This is what it is." Because
                 that's not it.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Out of character? I
                 never know. I think my
                 characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
                 "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
                 it may be out of character."</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I have a lot of Game of Thrones stuff on the cutting
                 room floor, before I decided what to actually post. And there is about 20 other
                 drabbles for the one series that haven't made it yet, because I'm one of those
                 writers.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I adore the Dorne
                 storyline in the books, and they completely butchered it in the show. So, that's why
                 I
                 was like, no Dorne's way smarter than this. So yes, he's going to be the Dorne that
                 you
                 get in the books.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Alternate universe, canon
                 divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
                 want to get blasted on that one.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
                 agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
                 dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
                 that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
                 Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
                 we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
                 that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
                 her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
                 supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
                 that.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
                 beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
                 thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's a poem that I really like. I can't remember the name of it now,
                 but it talks about moonlight, and how in moonlight, everything is very stark, and
                 it's
                 clearer for all that starkness. She's seeing everything for who he is.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Sansa is really presented as one of those girls with her
                 head in the clouds. She's definitely not a Margaery Tyrell. She was definitely never
                 really prepared for court
                 life. She has a view of it that is heavily skewed by stories of
                 [inaudible 00:33:28] of these wonderful knights in their shining armor, these
                 lovely ladies who are just ethereal in their beauty, everything being wrapped up
                 in a bow, happily ever after. Maybe something happens, but someone's always
                 rescued. And through the series, that kind of gets torn away
                 from her bit by bit. The Prince Charming that she thought was a Prince Charming is
                 definitely not. There's no one comes to save her. Her brother's more interested in
                 being a king than coming to rescue her from the tower, and the monsters inside it.
                 So really, Sansa's really forced to grow up,
                 and she's really forced to see all these stories as exactly what they are.
                 They're just stories. They're empty stories to make children
                 happy. So when she's thinking back on this, she's thinking more of the scarier
                 stories that maybe she didn't want to listen to.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>What I was afraid of, I should never have
                 been afraid of, what I wanted was the thing I should have been worried about.
                 She's really kind of flipped the script in her own mind. And
                 she's standing amongst these wolves, and it's like before, she would have been
                 terrified. She would have been cowering. And now she realizes, this is where I need
                 to be. This is where it's at.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>These were all things she's done because she believes in
                 Daenerys' vision, she believes in a world
                 without slavery. And after having been a slave and experienced freedom, that's
                 something she'd want for everybody. I hate to say it, Harriet Tubman, how many
                 times did she go back and she got slaves and ran them back out? Simply because
                 I'm free, no one should be in bondage, even if it's a personal risk to myself,
                 to my life, that is a risk I will take, because everyone should be free. And I
                 think as a former slave, Missandei really would have that
                 sentiment.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
                 seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
                 woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
                 anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
                 back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
                 Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
                 slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
                 she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
                 jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
                 great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
                 I've seen it before.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's a smile of, I
                 can't think of the word, but being resigned to my fate. And if this is it, then this
                 is it. And like I say, she recognizes in Cersei the same evil that she saw in
                 Astapor where she's kind of like, "No, you
                 would have fit in well with them. You may think that you're better, you may
                 think that you're better than people from Astapor. You may think that you're
                 better than slave owners and all this, that, and the other, but in the end you
                 are not. You are exactly like them." And in the end, she kind
                 of wants to let her know. It's kind of like a, "I know that you know that I know
                 that you know" moment. Like, I see you. You can't hide from me. I see exactly what
                 you are.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Like I
                 said, as a slave, as someone who's been freed, I can't imagine her ever wanting to
                 be in a situation where somebody would be using her against her will. And that would
                 be one thing I imagine you would promise yourself. Kind of like, I hate to use the
                 comparison, but if you ever get out of a really bad relationship, and you're just
                 like, "No, never again. I know the signs. I will never let that happen to me again."
                 And for her of course it's more extreme,
                 from being someone who was taken from freedom and put into slavery, lived a
                 decade plus as a slave, not having a will of their own, and then suddenly
                 getting that will back. No one's ever taking that from me. Like I said, I've
                 found myself. Now that I've found myself again, and I can be myself, I will die
                 myself.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But there are people who
                 they're really willing to engage with you, and they have questions. In a lot of
                 other fandoms, some people are just like, "This is a nice story." Game of Thrones
                 fans will have questions for you in the comments. They'll be like, "What about this?
                 And what about this? Oh, what about this? What do you think about this?" It's fun
                 to
                 get that dialog. That's something I never had before.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>In one of my other fics, there's the Deviant Lord. We
                 will run out of the character requirement, talking to each other back and forth in
                 comments about things.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I learned a little bit, I actually had to do a bit of
                 research on some of the fic, for things like trauma, and how people respond to
                 trauma. Especially in the case of Sansa and Missandei, how do people overcome
                 certain difficulties after being in these different positions? That was a little bit
                 interesting. I did a little bit of in-depth on that, because once again, I'm that
                 nerd.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually
                 had one troll who just wrote, "Fuck you, you bastard." And I was like, yes. I was
                 just like, "Whoa. Okay. I'm sorry you're having such a bad day. Go have a mimosa.
                 Just don't take it out on me."</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But
                 there are just people who are just nasty. In all the fandoms I've been in, it
                 thankfully hasn't happened to me yet, and I've actually had people defend me in
                 comments. They're just like, "Get that shit out of here." I'm like, "Okay, thank you
                 for being nice." But it seems the Game of Thrones fandoms can get real violent. They
                 get real virulent with their hatred in the comments section. I can't muster that
                 kind of hatred. If I don't like something, I just click off of it. I don't get the
                 hate.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, mostly
                 it was Googling, recovering from trauma. I did a little bit of research on former
                 slaves, to see their mindset. That was a little bit what I did use for the mindset
                 of Missandei. Because people who've been in that situation, they go through, what
                 is
                 it called? No, goodness, I can't remember. But it was a very good article, and it
                 was talking about how former slaves, they go through this process of not believing
                 that they're free, and not believing that they're free, and not believing that
                 they're free. And eventually, they get to a
                 point where it sticks in their head, that this is freedom. This is what they
                 have. No one can control them. And then, they get very, very almost violently
                 independent, where no one's going to tell me what to do. You can't tell me what
                 to do. No one's going to do that to me. Once again, how some
                 people where to a much lesser extent, when you get out of controlling, overbearing
                 relationships, and then you're finally free, and you're like, "Fuck that shit. Where
                 am I going? I'm staying out all night. And I don't have to tell anybody."
                 They get this burst of a sense of self, a
                 sense of purpose. And I thought that was very beautiful, that there are people
                 who can go through all that type of trauma, and they can get there, and they can
                 fully bloom. And I always saw Missandei as kind of that character, this
                 character who had gone through all of that to the point where here she is,
                 standing tall as a character that knows her own worth, knows her own
                 personage.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then with Sansa, just how people recover
                 from abusive and traumatic relationships, and things like that. The stages of
                 recovery.</li>
              <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's one thing, to me, if it's too OOC, just out of
                 the block  there's no real change, and these drabbles are
                 so short. You can't really see a lot of character development from A to B.
                 Everything kind of has to fit where it does. So I wanted to make sure that it fit
                 and it wasn't too crazy. It's a lot of research.</li>

          <h2>Writer's Agency: Reflection</h2>
          <div class="interview-search-analysis">
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p><strong>Definition:</strong>When fan authors reflect a particular writing choice, process, or moment in their writing. This may be the fan explaining specific choices they made that are not about their audience or motivation for writing.</p>
          <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 65</p>
          <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The interview moments coded as “Reflection” generally point to the author reflecting on a particular moment from their story. Reading through their quotes provides a sense of motivation behind writing choices as well as the particular thought process in capturing particular emotions or experiences. or choice they made. Pairing these quotes while reading their fics also creates an entire new experience, heightening our understanding of both the fanfic and the author. Their reflections demonstrate how personal and political writing fanfics can be.</p>
          <p>Each author’s quotes provide rich reflections of their choices; I will point to some of the quotes that demonstrate the interwoven nature of politics and personal experiences when writing fanfiction. Aria shares how she was learning about the Stonewall Riots at the time, which heavily impacted the direction of her piece. In the last chapter written of her piece, she shows police surveillance and violence targeting the LGBTQ+ community as the police harass community members hanging out at a bar in a metropolitan TLOK location. Aria pulls directly from history, adding in details such as folks needing to wear a particular number of clothing items that represent their culturally-prescribed gender.</p>
          <p>Kittya Cullen explains why she chose the metaphor of ants crawling across Asami’s skin to convey anxiety. She comes “from an area where you commonly come into contact with animals,” which means she is familiar with the sensation of ants crawling across her skin. By merging both her experiences with literal ants crawling on her skin and her experience with anxiety, Kittya creates a compelling, tangible metaphor.</p>
          <p>In Dialux’s fanfic, she focuses on Sansa practicing Hinduism to demonstrate the isolation Sansa is experiencing. Sansa, in Dialux’s fanfic, has an arranged marriage where she must move far away from her home and culture; there are no Hindu people in her new home or region, so she is the only person who practices. While Sansa, much like Jodhaa from the film <cite>Jodhaa Akbar</cite>, becomes more comfortable with her new home, she continues to practice Hinduism and stays true to her faith. Sansa’s refusal to assimilate demonstrates her power and agency.</p>
          <p>Similarly, Writegirl also demonstrates the power and agency of characters who are in subjugated positions. Writegirl reimagines the scene when Missandei is murdered, imagining how Missandei — a Black woman — would speak back to Cersei — a White queen who is intending to kill Missandei. In Writegirl’s reimagining, Missandei “[is] really seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born woman in Westeros.” Missandei also compares Cersei to enslavers from Missandei’s homeland. Writegirl’s comparison between Cersei — a White woman in power — to an enslaver also hints at a deeper, political perspective of overt and tacit oppression. Enslavers enact overt oppression, enslaving people from particular cultural backgrounds; meanwhile, Cersei uses a freed woman who escaped slavery as a political pawn for her own gain.</p>
          <p>Valk shares backstory information from their fanfic, when Jaime’s father catches Jaime trying on his mother’s shoes, that Valk does not include in the fanfic. Valk imagines Jaime’s experience learning gender roles and expectations — an experience many share — as well as how this learning hurt him. Valk’s reveal about Jaime’s backstory reveals how authors use experiences to help shape and understand characters’ psychologies. These experiences, like Kittya and the ants, may be based on their own individual experiences or, like Aria and the Stonewall Riots, contextual experiences that they may relate to. Even the smallest choice made both in the final product of the fanfic as well as the process of brainstorming, imagining, and drafting the fanfic are interwoven with personal experiences, emotion, motivation, and politics.</p>

             <h3>Quotes</h3>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I wrote a piece called Addict's Alchemy, which was a piece about...in terms of
                   servicing some of the same things we're talking about today. It's a piece about about
                   trauma... And it [inaudible 00:05:20], that this isn't obviously. It's a piece about
                   trauma and it's a piece about, what does it mean... Really they're both pieces about
                   what it means to be disabled.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is I think the first piece where I write as a adult writer looking at the world
                   and going, "Okay, what do I actually think? What can I say about this that is interesting,"
                   instead of just being like, "I don't know, let's take a thought and just run with
                   it." I think that in a lot of ways it suffers of being really in that space, but it's
                   also a good piece in that I'm genuinely, actually doing literature, in a way that
                   I really was not before.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>First of all I wrote about suicide at a time where I was not ready to talk about it,
                   as a writer. I'm still not sure I can actually talk about suicide now, in a way that's
                   beneficial or useful for me. I'm not sure now I can do that now, or could not do it
                   now, but I could not do it at the time, or I couldn't do it in a way that was healthy.
                   I know I wrote it that it would seem therapeutic, but I also was being retraumatized,
                   and I didn't say that obviously in the tags.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love story
                   about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not make
                   those two pieces meld at the time. The story arcs just never came together, and I
                   couldn't harmonize them, and it sort of died because I couldn't get to the thing I
                   was trying to make, not ambition, but I couldn't make either one of them make sense.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I thought it was romantic. I don't remember why I did that, that's one of
                   the ones where just... I think it's part of I had that as sort of my first... It was
                   more like one of the most basic tools that I learned, so I learned, "All right, I'll
                   do alternate points of view."</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't know if I thought about this as a storytelling tool at times, or I thought
                   about it as a storytelling tool obviously that helps power [inaudible 00:17:00], not
                   necessarily about the story if it makes sense. I wasn't telling you things that had
                   happened in the past, to teach you what happened in the past. I was saying, "This
                   is what's haunting the characters, this is what the characters can't escape from in
                   a very physical, visceral fashion." Well maybe physical might be the wrong word, you
                   know what, I'm okay with it, body and mind, if it makes sense.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Because I imagine Korra's pain is seeing the cost of her new trauma after time, because
                   her being injured, being in a place where you are tortured to death as a vulnerability.
                   Every time you experience that pain, I imagine that that's a place that engagement
                   is a struggle after time when you're in that pain. So it's an ordeal for Korra to
                   dress herself.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And so Asami plays that role, being a person to whom Korra wants to relate, is thrilled
                   to relate, is not scared, or she is a little bit scared to relate, but is she scared
                   to relate in the way that she's scared to relate to other people.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Whereas Korra grows up in this institution, Asami grows up with a relatively politically
                   progressive father. He's an abuser, but he's also a very, very politically progressive
                   man. He's a radical, he tries to overthrow his government, make the world a more equitable
                   and fair place. It's self-interested, he's a bourgeois radical, but I wouldn't have
                   said that at the time. I imagine Asami as having a relatively normal, relatively healthy
                   understanding of the world in a way, having felt like she, not just knowing that a
                   woman can love another woman, because I guess almost every person in this world knows.
                   This is nothing like, Korra is particularly going to have a hard time because of that
                   institution itself.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>He's not particularly flawed, because he's willing to play this opportunistic political
                   game. Because he's also capable of looking at his child and going, "Maybe I shouldn't
                   do that." </li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I also sort of wanted to talk... I sort of was thinking about the limits of the political
                   and the [inaudible 00:35:57] of the political. You could do what, when and where,
                   the idea that a politician can't really save the world. I don't know if I was all
                   the way to, "We have to do it," yet, but I think I'm getting there.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was thinking about New York City around the times of the Stonewall Riots. This is
                   where those politics come in. I was playing with, what does it mean... I was playing
                   with, what's particularly violent political oppression? What are the limits of political
                   oppression in a relatively liberal cosmopolitan society? Because I was getting that
                   sense of, there's actually a whole lot of ways that political oppression can happen
                   that I'd never even thought about at this point, and I was learning about that. So
                   I was writing about this character as someone who's experiencing the limits of that
                   political oppression. And this is actually one of the key storylines in my opinion,
                   and it's ultimately a story about resistance to a kind of political oppression</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This was written obviously before Donald Trump becomes President, and I could see
                   all sorts of things about reaction again. But I was seeing the reaction, I was scared.
                   I don't know where I got this, there was something bad was coming. I knew that I had
                   that sense of fear, so I was writing about... I guess writing a little bit about,
                   how do we fight back when things get worse?</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, that was one fic that I was relatively and very
                   proud of. To be honest.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And if you're just starting from scratch, then it's
                   difficult to create why two people would hate each other so much. I mean, you need
                   to have that religious, and
                   cultural, and those barriers in order for that to
                   happen.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Where I
                   just didn't translate them into Rajput or Hindi words. Because I just use
                   whatever I knew, because I speak Kannada at home. And that's
                   another language entirely. And I was just running out of time, and I said, "You know
                   what? No, I'll just handle it myself. And not translate it, and hope that nobody
                   minds.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was literally
                   just pulling things from here, and there. And, I mean, there's Rajput culture as well
                   as
                   South Indian culture, as well as there's some random, I think, there's some
                   Bengali culture that I just threw in for the hell of it.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But, yeah. I think just developing the list of material
                   and everything kind of helped me understand on a step by step process, everything
                   that I had kind of... The assumptions that I had made, and where I had taken certain
                   ideas from.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And
                   especially when she has that fight with Jon and she goes back home. And that was,
                   I
                   think, the point of catharsis. Because especially when you're looking at a lot of
                   Indian mothers, and Indian
                   women who get into marriages at a very young age. You have to deal with your
                   husband's family, you have to deal with that entire kind of stigma. About you
                   have to be the one to adjust and to compromise to a far greater extent than your
                   husband. And all of these kind of had come together and had
                   been marinating for a very long time. And I feel like Sansa, in this, was very much
                   the product of that. Where she was
                   just trying to fight it, she was such a perfect child in that culture. And then
                   suddenly she has to kind of leave her culture behind. Or, not leave her culture
                   behind, but adjust to a new culture. And she feels like she's
                   being punished by her old one for no fault of her own. And all of it, kind of, her
                   desperate unhappiness, her tensions with her mother were a big part of the fic, I
                   think, for me.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I
                   didn't feel like I could end it with, "Oh, everybody has kids and they're all
                   happy." Because that felt very weird, and kind of disjointed with the rest of the
                   fic.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And
                   in that Sansa can see ghosts. And throughout the entire fic, it's a long fic and
                   everything, but one of the biggest issues for me was, how do I end this?</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But to me, it felt like it began with Jon and
                   it had to end with Jon. And it had to end with him finally being triumphant, and
                   finally being happy for his triumph at the end of this fanfic.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But then the cultural tensions stem almost entirely
                   from the differences within their upbringing, I'm pretty sure. Within their
                   families. And I mean, there are
                   cultural differences within, I mean, people that I've grown up with in India,
                   and people in the U.S. And even though you're living side by side, that doesn't
                   necessarily mean that you have the same cultural background.
                   And I think that's something that both of them don't understand. And both of them
                   kind of try to understand slowly.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And if you're talking about other moments,
                   like when Sansa wants to give Jon his name, and he asks her to read it out loud. I
                   think that's another moment of compromise. Because as much as she's giving him the
                   gift,
                   she's also giving him his name. And she's stepping across her own cultural
                   boundaries to help him with that, which Jon doesn't completely
                   understand.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
                   that was something that even when you agree to a marriage, and even when you kind
                   of
                   accept that. Especially when you go into your husband's house, and if you're living
                   with his parents and everything. It's a very difficult concept. And it's a very
                   difficult idea. And adjusting to that
                   is a huge, almost, culture shock to people.
                   To any women, adjusting to that is
                   difficult. No matter who it is, no matter where you're going.
                   So, then, I mean, especially for Sansa, who needs to leave behind her entire family.
                   And doesn't even know when she'll be able to go back. And has to go to a foreign country
                   without any
                   support, and any of her own traditions. She's the one that's upheld every single
                   tradition she has ever done. And especially when you're looking at the Hindu
                   culture, it's very difficult to uphold them.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then, finally, she
                   slowly starts to grow into that. She starts to give moments of peace. You know,
                   she's kind of giving Jon gifts, and she's trying to bridge that gap. Because she
                   also realizes that it's her life, too. Which, I think, is one of the biggest
                   realizations that a lot of women have. Which is, "Yes, I'm miserable. I want you to
                   be miserable. But how am I going
                   to be miserable for?" You need to let some things go, you need to move on past
                   the injustices... I need to move past the injustices that I have
                   faced.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>The one quote that you picked out here, "You stand before your father, bedecked in
                   gossamer and lace and silk, glass thick and shining in your hair." Because that was
                   one that I actually remember. Because I initially put the word jewel, and jewels in
                   the place of the word glass. But then I wanted it, for her, to feel that it was
                   cheaper than the jewel. Even if she had them, they didn't matter to her. Because it
                   was just glass.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>As if, her family... Or, she's feeling as if her family is not willing to give
                   her as much as she is owed when she's going into a
                   marriage.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But then, I also think that one of the major
                   things that I learned was probably that some of the anger, it doesn't have to be a
                   very you anger to be a very deep one. For it to seep into your writing. Because a
                   lot of the time, especially when I'm writing angry stories and everything, they tend
                   to be immediate. Like, "Okay, I'm very angry right now. And I want to have a fit.
                   And I want to do it." But this was something that it had kind have been, I think,
                   brewing for a very long time. And then suddenly the anger, and the angst, and the
                   hurt, and the pain, all kind of came out. But at the same time, it was not just
                   that. It was also about passing through that anger, and knowing that there is going
                   to be someone at the end of it who's willing to accept you.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I hate that I did it, but I did real-person
                   fanfiction for Paramore. Thinking of it now, it's always like, "God, that's not
                   good. I shouldn't have done it, but here we are."</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I'm
                   trying to write something that's original, and that's always a bit more of an
                   endeavor than you expect it to be.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's funny, going back to the original ones, the
                   older ones at least, and reading those, because you sent me one. I think it was
                   chapter 37 you mentioned in your email, and I went back and read it and I was like,
                   "Oof, I could do this a lot better now, I hope."</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's a couple that, I don't
                   remember which ones, but there were a couple that I sort of left on a weird note
                   [inaudible 00:09:21] on purpose, so that it had to be
                   like, "Okay, well, maybe you want more, or maybe it's good as it is," and I liked
                   that.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I also like that you can sort of see a progression of
                   how I wrote them and how my own skills have maybe, hopefully developed. And even
                   just, it did end up being four years' worth of time</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>so it was, when I think I started it, Korrasami hadn't
                   been canon yet. So, it's definitely interesting, the before and after.
                   And maybe, I think,
                   during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
                   different attitudes in that. I think those are some of the
                   strengths in seeing that as well.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, I'm
                   very much a person who believes in, if you can't say it in like two words
                   then you probably shouldn't. So, I like to have it, what
                   is this thing? And that's it. I like to be able to say, "This is what it's going to
                   be," and it doesn't necessarily need to be more complicated than that.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> So, in this one in particular, she's trying to have a good experience and maybe power
                   through it, but then, in that brief lapse where she forgets that she's tied down
                   and then she tries to sit up, it's sort of like a muscle memory thing, where
                   she's back there the last time she was chained up and couldn't
                   move. But also, at the same time, I wanted Asami to immediately
                   be there and to be immediately helpful and not push her. She was just trying to be
                   comforting. You hear stories about how people
                   try and be helpful and just make situations worse, but at this
                   point in their relationship, Korra and Asami knew each other super well, and even
                   though this is an unusual situation for them, Asami knows how Korra reacts and knows
                   who she is and what she's thinking. She's able to help her come back slowly, rather
                   than try and make it a quick thing.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, I think I'd notice, not spacing errors, pacing
                   errors in that, I could've slowed that down a bit, I could've drawn the reader in
                   a
                   little bit more, just things like that, where it's just like, "I maybe know how to
                   write now," so it hopefully could've made it a little bit more
                   engaging.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I
                   try and put good outcomes for Korra, in that she's living the life that she wanted
                   to live with a person she loves, doing
                   something she loves. And even though it maybe needs to be a little bit more
                   complicated, because of hormones or things like that, but it's not a huge
                   obstacle, it's just a little something to add to the day. But
                   yeah, it's like the whole mood of most of the things I try and write. I want it to
                   be happy.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>For
                   this particular fic, I think it was just the imagery. I was really trying to grasp
                   something that in some ways is so intangible. I was trying so hard to get just that
                   feeling of desolation and aching.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But the metaphor itself of the Marching Ants, it was
                   this way of articulating the anxiety that comes along with that.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I think it
                   just came back to capturing that, the imagery of it, the tone of the chapter, the
                   voice of it because, at least to me, it works really hard to put us in Asami's shoes
                   and make us experience it exactly as she's experiencing it.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I guess the sensation of ants ... I come from an area
                   where you commonly come into contact with animals and so on, so I'm familiar with
                   the actual physical reality of ants crawling across your skin, and there's a way
                   that it feels. It's like a sort of weird, prickling sensation that is very
                   disconcerting, and I guess I wanted to translate that into how the story reflects
                   Asami's own experience with whatever she's feeling. And that imagery just seemed to
                   click with that, just the experience of having something under your skin and on your
                   skin, even if you can't quite articulate what it is.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
                   think I was both going for an understanding of how Asami herself is effected by this
                   really terrible thing we see happen to Korra.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It's just to be someone who builds and creates
                   with the purpose of fixing or making better, but then not being able to do so for
                   someone within your personal life. But the imagery also for that chapter was, I guess,
                   built in subtext because I wasn't
                   quite sure yet how to engage with what was happening in ways that were visible
                   to other people outside of the fan community, the slashfan
                   community.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Of course, being
                   younger, you don't really understand romance all
                   typically well. It's all very idealized. Then as I got older, I
                   started liking to delve more into different types of friendships as well.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>My strengths in this fic for me was being able to try and incorporate as much of
                   Jaime and Brienne's banter and relationship, as much as I could to a modern setting
                   because obviously they wouldn't be having as
                   much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
                   considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
                   day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
                   from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
                   versa. There was a challenge of trying to see, okay, Brienne
                   wouldn't have had as traumatic a childhood probably regarding her own gender
                   identity. But there would definitely be some push
                   back, but how would that change based on the setting?
                   I made her a little bit more comfortable in
                   her skin than Jaime and also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive
                   shoulder for Jaime
                   who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
                   well.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>writing it also based off
                   of my own experiences, just exploring the LGBT
                   community in my area, I was kind of writing it from that
                   perspective, but also not having as much information as I would like. </li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>While I do ship them together romantically, I
                   wanted to write something that also reflected that you could do like a very intimate
                   moment without bring sex into it as well.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think he definitely
                   is someone that would pick up on someone's interests and what not and what that
                   means to them, either subconsciously or consciously channel it when he's handling
                   it.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think it's because he's used to having to perform any
                   way and being very new, if you're very new into
                   like trying to question your gender identity, especially being a man, you are at
                   a higher risk of...I should say more so, if you present male than you are at a
                   higher risk of facing violence or any kind of physical outlashing. Be it verbal
                   or physical, but I think it's a lot of like, you learn to be very secretive.
                   You'll act in ways to protect yourself, more than
                   anything.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It went
                   into his relationship with his father, he was caught walking in his mother's red
                   heels and he got very scolded and punished for it.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>If I were to do this fic over again or
                   update it or add on to it, I would definitely
                   want to go more into his disability as well as his prosthetic and how it worked
                   more. Things like that to sort of flush it out more because I
                   don't think in the fic I didn't do the best job I could at it. It was sort of
                   something I tried to fill out as much as I could in the fic, but I probably could
                   have done better.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was
                   definitely a good writing practice for me also, in terms of knowing that I could go
                   back and explore myself with fan
                   fic if I needed to as well.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because I'm
                   a length whore. That's the problem. I get into these fics, and I have these ideas,
                   and then they expand out of control, and then I get into a story that's suddenly 30
                   chapters long, and then I run out of steam. I'm one of those authors who does kind
                   of get bored, and then starts cheating on my fic, which is happening right now in
                   Game of Thrones.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think the strength is, I do try and keep it as much as
                   I can in character, and in situ, I guess. I don't like to pull too much of other
                   outside influences in. I think the strength is that people can read it and they can
                   really see it sliding into canon. And if you go into something aside, you don't have
                   to bump too much. And it would fit in the overall narrative.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I have a very hard time
                   getting into certain characters' heads, and seeing like, okay, is this the
                   motivation that they would have? Because I do take that very seriously. So, there
                   are times I'm just like, I can't see this person doing this. I can't see them doing
                   that. How do I get this to fit in with their character and not make it too over the
                   top, or too OOC? That's one of my main challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She was
                   supposed to kind of get lost in the trees, and they were supposed to find her. But
                   I
                   thought that was a little bit ignominious for her. So then I remembered, Oh,
                   Nimeria's wolf pack. I was like, they haven't used that in the show at all, so why
                   not?</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's a poem that I really like. I can't remember the name of it now,
                   but it talks about moonlight, and how in moonlight, everything is very stark, and
                   it's
                   clearer for all that starkness. She's seeing everything for who he is.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Sansa is really presented as one of those girls with her
                   head in the clouds. She's definitely not a Margaery Tyrell. She was definitely never
                   really prepared for court
                   life. She has a view of it that is heavily skewed by stories of
                   [inaudible 00:33:28] of these wonderful knights in their shining armor, these
                   lovely ladies who are just ethereal in their beauty, everything being wrapped up
                   in a bow, happily ever after. Maybe something happens, but someone's always
                   rescued. And through the series, that kind of gets torn away
                   from her bit by bit. The Prince Charming that she thought was a Prince Charming is
                   definitely not. There's no one comes to save her. Her brother's more interested in
                   being a king than coming to rescue her from the tower, and the monsters inside it.
                   So really, Sansa's really forced to grow up,
                   and she's really forced to see all these stories as exactly what they are.
                   They're just stories. They're empty stories to make children
                   happy. So when she's thinking back on this, she's thinking more of the scarier
                   stories that maybe she didn't want to listen to.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>What I was afraid of, I should never have
                   been afraid of, what I wanted was the thing I should have been worried about.
                   She's really kind of flipped the script in her own mind. And
                   she's standing amongst these wolves, and it's like before, she would have been
                   terrified. She would have been cowering. And now she realizes, this is where I need
                   to be. This is where it's at.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>These were all things she's done because she believes in
                   Daenerys' vision, she believes in a world
                   without slavery. And after having been a slave and experienced freedom, that's
                   something she'd want for everybody. I hate to say it, Harriet Tubman, how many
                   times did she go back and she got slaves and ran them back out? Simply because
                   I'm free, no one should be in bondage, even if it's a personal risk to myself,
                   to my life, that is a risk I will take, because everyone should be free. And I
                   think as a former slave, Missandei really would have that
                   sentiment.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
                   seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
                   woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
                   anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
                   back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
                   Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
                   slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
                   she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
                   jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
                   great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
                   I've seen it before.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's a smile of, I
                   can't think of the word, but being resigned to my fate. And if this is it, then this
                   is it. And like I say, she recognizes in Cersei the same evil that she saw in
                   Astapor where she's kind of like, "No, you
                   would have fit in well with them. You may think that you're better, you may
                   think that you're better than people from Astapor. You may think that you're
                   better than slave owners and all this, that, and the other, but in the end you
                   are not. You are exactly like them." And in the end, she kind
                   of wants to let her know. It's kind of like a, "I know that you know that I know
                   that you know" moment. Like, I see you. You can't hide from me. I see exactly what
                   you are.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Like I
                   said, as a slave, as someone who's been freed, I can't imagine her ever wanting to
                   be in a situation where somebody would be using her against her will. And that would
                   be one thing I imagine you would promise yourself. Kind of like, I hate to use the
                   comparison, but if you ever get out of a really bad relationship, and you're just
                   like, "No, never again. I know the signs. I will never let that happen to me again."
                   And for her of course it's more extreme,
                   from being someone who was taken from freedom and put into slavery, lived a
                   decade plus as a slave, not having a will of their own, and then suddenly
                   getting that will back. No one's ever taking that from me. Like I said, I've
                   found myself. Now that I've found myself again, and I can be myself, I will die
                   myself.</li>

          <h2>Writer's Agency: Motivation</h2>
          <div class="interview-search-analysis">
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors mention their motivation for writing their fanfic or another piece. This may be their own motivation, but also their assumed motivations in the fan community.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 61</p>
          <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Common patterns appear across the fan authors’ different motivations for writing their fanfics. First, several fan authors suggest that external circumstances, separate from the original text, influenced their decision to write. For example, Dialux wrote a <cite>Harry Potter</cite> fanfic after her disappointment in the 2020 Democratic primaries. She reimagines Percy Weasley as running on a platform of large systemic change — similar to Bernie Sanders’ platform — and winning, explaining that she needed “some sort of catharsis” as Bernie’s chances of being nominated began to decrease. Aria also discusses how she wrote her fanfic at a time when she was reading about Stonewall, learning about trauma and disability, and being radicalized. Her motivation to write her fanfic was partially a result of her exploring her new political turn and embracing her radicalization.</p>
          <p>Another motivation several fan authors point to is their desire to explore particular aspects of their identity and/or think through forms of representation that link to their own identities and positionalities. Valk shares how they were questioning their own gender identity — exploring whether they are non-binary — while they wrote their fanfic about Jaime questioning his gender. For Valk, fanfics are a “safe” method for identity exploration. Kittya is also interested in exploring characters outside of positions of power, specifically citing because she is a Black woman. Finally, Dialux cites her motivation for writing a <cite>Fleabag</cite> fanfic as entangled with reflecting on her own journey growing up and changing her perspective about what she wanted for her life.</p>

Finally, Dialux cites her motivation for writing a Fleabag fanfic as entangled with reflecting on her own journey growing up and changing her perspective about what she wanted for her life.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, fan authors also conduct canon resistant uptakes when they are unhappy with a particular choice made in the original text. Writegirl chooses to write about both Sansa and Missandei due to her frustration with the original text writers’ choices. She believes Sansa suffers a “character assassination” and expresses frustration over Missandei’s death, especially how much her death scene moved away from who her character is in earlier seasons and the novels. Valk also expresses frustration with the heteronormativity embedded in both GOT and the fandom. They reimagine Jaime and Brienne’s characters in ways that challenge how fans often depict their relationship.</p>
          <p>Finally, Aria provides a moment of reflection not only about her motivation for writing fanfic, but why storytelling can be crucial. She says, “There's a study I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about things you don't convince them, but if you tell stories you can.” Writing fanfics for Aria and for many of these fan authors is not only about loving these original texts and fan communities, but building a platform to reach and affectively impact their audiences so they may see the world through different perspectives and reshape their politics.</p>

             <h3>Quotes</h3>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Some of the pieces I wrote just no longer work as Homestuck pieces because the characters
                   have been changed, and I was like, "I can't really write this story about two women
                   in love because one of them isn't a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>When I'm writing this fic it means something, because I'm like... There's a study
                   I think that says that when you get into rational arguments about things you don't
                   convince them, but if you tell stories you can. And I think that I'm in that place,
                   arguing about politics in the fiction space of the internet.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
                   context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
                   very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
                   you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
                   original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
                   through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
                   and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
                   with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
                   get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
                   you.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was coming into my own politically, I was becoming my own political individual in
                   a way I hadn't been before. Like I had politics, but this is around the time that
                   I'm really radicalized, and just me engaging with those contexts.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so
                   I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And
                   already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They
                   weren't things I was writing about at the time.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters.
                   I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short,
                   but it felt more like a nod than a full</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong> There are things I don't like about it, but I like it as a little bit of text. It's
                   there in the text, it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love
                   feeling represented." So I wrote that.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
                   a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
                   different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
                   in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
                   and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
                   looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>but this is what I was doing with my life. I was on my way to running a queer resource
                   center at a college, so I was doing the work of feeling the political implications
                   of things in the world. And so I was, for me the most natural thing to write about
                   is to write about... Not just homophobia, although this was a story about homophobia,
                   not just homophobia, but this was a story about queerness and politics. And because
                   this was the thing that was radicalizing me, [inaudible] is vile, because... And it
                   was about violence, so I don't just mean violence as a method of resistance, I mean
                   violence as a thing that people survive. Because that's what's radicalizing me at
                   the time. And so I felt the need to wake up that in a sense.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I was just engaging with the text's portrayal of trauma.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think of a place I was there, and this was particularly...I was engaging with political
                   institutions at the time that were much, much bigger than me, particularly family
                   institutions. My family was pretty chill, but running a queer resource center at community
                   college is like, getting that [inaudible 00:24:12]. You would deal with a bunch of
                   people that were writing about the problems for being gay, or feeling like they can't
                   talk about it, or being the only source of information, of being part of an institution
                   that was the only source of information.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was trying to write a story that engaged with trauma and felt authentic and didn't
                   make trauma seem like the end of the world. Because the binary that's in a lot of
                   literature is either like, "Oh, you either overcame trauma, or you are doomed to misery
                   forever." And I was trying to find some middle ground, trying to tell a story that
                   felt authentic.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wanted to tell a story about connection. And I wanted to make it clear that when
                   I'm telling the story, I think that even [inaudible 00:26:39] understands that it's
                   not really about romance as much as it is about feeling connected in a genuine way
                   to people, that that central theme, building a life worth living after injury, or
                   after trauma, is finding an authentic realtionship with people.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>In the context of this piece, a lot of my understanding of Hiroshi as a bourgeois
                   radical is that I'm not going to have a [inaudible 00:30:36], because I don't really
                   have a sense of class politics at the time, or have the beginnings of that study.
                   That's only beginning to be born</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wanted to give a sense of what is the politics of the Northern Water Tribe? And
                   I kind of wanted to say that queerness isn't criminalized in the Northern Water Tribe,
                   or is not criminalized anymore. Also I wanted to say this is a different relationship.
                   But the other thing I wanted to talk about is, what are politicians willing to give
                   up for their family, and what are they not?</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But I've also recently published work in Fleabag, which
                   was one of the fandoms that I had to write for for my Yuletide assignment.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>There's a couple of things that you see that are kind of
                   interesting, and then you kind of identify a certain actor, or a certain character
                   that you kind of find interesting. And then jump from there to another.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yes. I think my most recent published fanfiction is a
                   Percy Weasley, second person point of view, post canon. In which he is attempting
                   to
                   basically restructure his society by running on a platform of big structural change.
                   Which might sound vaguely familiar.  But it was, I
                   think, mostly due to the kind of deep rage that I was feeling over the entire
                   Democratic Primaries over the past couple of months. And almost the past year.
                   In which everything felt very much like a lot of talk, and not a lot of doing.
                   And at some point, you need some catharsis. And kind of putting it out into
                   fiction and seeing something changing. Or, not even seeing something changing.
                   But seeing people trying to effect change, and willing to fight for that change
                   felt very important to me. And basically that entire fanfic is kind of born out
                   of that seething, massive, "I want to see something happening."
                   And I will see it happen in fiction, if not in reality.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>was talking about that, and I felt like
                   that was a really fascinating look into that psyche. And seeing how Fleabag and the
                   Priest would meet up. And how they would be after having separated for 20, 30 years,
                   coming back to see each other after they have had full lives apart, but somehow
                   still wanting something more. Which, I think, it's definitely, kind of, for me, I
                   am
                   not old enough to be discussing 50 year old, 60 year old life plans. But my life
                   path has never been very straight, or what I felt that it would be. Because when I
                   was, what? 15, I probably thought I'd be an engineer. And then after that I thought
                   I'd be a doctor. And then, suddenly, now I'm a lawyer. And I thought I'd be in the
                   U.S., and I'm in India. And it's a very wildly divergent and strange life path for
                   me. And that's only been over, what? 10 years, 10, 15 years. And I can't even
                   imagine how that would be over 20, 30 years. And identifying that desire for home,
                   and wanting people to be that. As opposed to a given area, or a given job, or
                   anything like that, felt very poignant to me at that particular point in
                   time.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, when I wrote this fanfic it was actually one of
                   the... I had signed up for a fic exchange for this one, as well. It's called the
                   Jonsa Exchange. It was their fifth round. Their theme was, "Inspired by
                   film."</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I mean, I think the
                   choice to make Westeros Desi was more of, I don't want to do that much work in
                   setting up all of these tensions, and identifying them. And kind of building, and
                   trying to communicate that to the reader when there's already preexisting framework
                   for it.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And there were a lot of really good fanfic there that used second person point of
                   view. And I felt like they kind of gave an insight into the character in a way that
                   you wouldn't be able to get if you were looking at them from a third person point
                   of
                   view. And when I was doing this fanfic, I was really kind of thinking about how and
                   what I wanted to communicate. And I felt like the second person point of view gave
                   more weight to the entire fanfic, as opposed to the third person.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, that was one of the
                   primary reasons why I decided to make it in the first place. Because I wanted to be
                   sure why and where I was getting these ideas from.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
                   very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
                   queer
                   characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
                   go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
                   their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
                   situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, it was definitely, when I first started it, it
                   was, "Okay, well, I kind of just want to write, and I want to get better at writing,
                   practicing it." I started it in college, and the professor I had at that time kept
                   saying how, "If you want to get better at writing, you have to write 50,000 words,
                   and then, you have to write another 50,000." "Really? All right. I'll just write,
                   then. People will give me prompts and I'll just write those as they come in." And
                   then, there were a lot of prompts that came in, surprisingly. I was able to stay
                   consistent with it for, I want to say, two, three years.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I didn't necessarily want to
                   do full-length fics. I sort of wanted to just spit them out, and then, it came to
                   a
                   point where I was like, "Okay, well, I don't want to have individual listings for
                   each of these," so I just put it all into one thing on AO3 and decided that, "Well,
                   all right, I'll just do the prompts as the chapter titles and just go until I
                   can't."</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, I would start to feel guilty, and sometimes
                   would just push one out whether or not I felt it was up to par, even though I hoped
                   it was.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>The first being that we
                   only get a certain amount of them in canon.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
                   it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
                   since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
                   until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
                   a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
                   decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
                   this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
                   case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
                   Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
                   bit.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, for that chapter, I want to say, like everything
                   else in the collection, it was a prompt, but it was something that I didn't want to
                   ham-fist it, because Korra's definitely, she's
                   traumatized. We see that more than once,</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, again, it was the prompts, but it was
                   also, I have personally been a little conflicted on gender for a while, and it's
                   like my sexuality, it was something that I sort of just say, "Well, I'll get to
                   that when I have the chance." So, it's always just sort of in
                   the back of my head</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And especially for this, it's not a
                   serious work, it's meant to be something fun, it's meant to be something that is
                   just for other people to enjoy. And I wouldn't be enjoying it if I was writing those
                   things that made me super uncomfortable.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>even
                   though I will always love Korra and Asami, it's not necessarily always easy to write
                   for that, if you're not getting constant updates for it.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>It was
                   partially based on a drawing by [inaudible 00:50:02] that had
                   Korra and Asami sitting under a tree and just looking out over Republic City,</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I wanted it to, like everything
                   else, just be soft and be a way of saying, this is their city, their lives are going
                   to go on, and they're going to be happy and enjoy it.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And I also wanted to give the collection itself a
                   sendoff I was proud of. So, I spent a little bit more time on that than I did a lot
                   of the other stuff, just let it marinate. "You know what? This is a good end, and
                   hope you enjoyed," sort of thing.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So now,
                   I sort of write when I want to, when I have the motivation. And if I'm feeling it,
                   yeah, I'll do a little bit. Like somebody requested a prompt two weeks ago. I was
                   like, "You know what? Why not. I'm feeling it. We're going to go for it."</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think I started writing
                   fan fiction in earnest because I was homesick. Because I had recently moved, and so
                   it was with the intent of writing something that was close to home but also part of
                   fandom that I started doing that.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But I
                   think with Twilight it was just that phase where you finally find a
                   story that speaks to you, even if you kind of hate it when you look back at it when
                   you're older. But at the time, how
                   Bella was written both as someone who was insular and chooses to form or has a
                   small community and so forth and deals with depression or
                   whatever it is, it just seemed to be something that I could relate to. And so
                   I was both interested in that, and I guess in the power fantasy that she was written
                   to
                   come in to. Usually, at least for me at the time, it wasn't really common to see those
                   characters have that kind of a glow-up, you can say.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
                   was on Twitter casually scrolling through something, and someone from back home
                   happened to mention how the finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background
                   and
                   the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
                   that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
                   Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
                   I
                   could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
                   been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
                   how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I kind of wanted to see that explored in my own way. And with Asami in particular,
                   and this was surprising for me because usually I'm all for the main character. I
                   never really remember to think about the other ... But with Asami, it felt like
                   there was this big gap available to us for exploration.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So I kind of wanted to explore that and see how
                   Asami herself was dealing with it. Because for me I like to see how the characters
                   are responding to what's happening to them rather than having the plot happen to
                   them, and with Asami there was just so much room to do that.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>
                   And in terms of relationships and love and so forth, it was I guess just coming back
                   to what I like to explore in fiction, which is how people are interacting with each
                   other, what it means for them. And especially for certain characters who are ... I'm
                   not sure how I'm thinking of this, but I think what I'm thinking of is where the
                   audience may usually dismiss them or not consider them worthy of further
                   exploration. So I like to see for myself how their worth is existing within these
                   relationships, what it means for them and what it can mean for the audience and so
                   forth.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With the case of Asami and her father, I think it just
                   came back to how they wrote the final book for the series. I found it fascinating
                   that Asami had reached out to her father after what had happened.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Whereas, for
                   Asami, Asami didn't have anyone, or at least maybe in her head she didn't have
                   anyone. So she went back to someone, I
                   guess who is an ... I wouldn't say an abuser because there isn't that dynamic
                   for them. But in the way that the relationship shifts from love and care to an
                   act of violence ... I don't know. I just wanted to explore
                   that. It's just fascinating to me to see how people who were deeply hurt somehow
                   still find a way to circle back around to the people who have hurt
                   them.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So both as a black person and as a woman, it was
                   just important for me to recognize that in text and get around to exploring what
                   that might have meant for other characters who weren't within the Circle of the
                   Avatar and had powerful connections.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I'm non-binary, so a lot of my work as I got older started
                   to deal more with gender as well as sexuality, also being
                   bi-sexual. I used it sort of as a tool in some fanfics to work
                   through ideas or feelings that I'd had and didn't know how to properly verbalize
                   yet. I was putting them on paper, using another
                   character as the medium and expressing or exploring different ideas in an area
                   where I felt I was kind of safe to do so. I didn't always
                   publish all of them, but the one that you contacted me over, I did,
                   obviously.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was around the
                   time when I was questioning whether or not I was non-binary and
                   I tried to sort of work things out with Jaime as the main focal character</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It's
                   something that I wanted to, again, wanted to bring into a fanfic to kind of make it
                   more relatable to me, but also to other people who might be reading this and
                   wondering the same thing.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>There's a lot of, again, fanfic already out there of
                   them being intimate, but it was all
                   very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
                   vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.
                   I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
                   own instead.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I really wanted
                   to address the gender issue and the gender questioning and write how the
                   experiences hit the hardest for me when I was thinking about
                   it. Definitely.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>trying to work through gender things. I
                   wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
                   their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
                   that would fit them better or explore better. I wanted to also
                   work through those emotions with me.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
                   Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
                   Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
                   no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
                   brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
                   thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
                   wrote a Game of Thrones fanfiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
                   series, the first one.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't
                   know if you're a Dr. Who fan. One of my favorite Doctor Who episodes is Turn Left.
                   And
                   it's a whole episode that's based on the concept of, what if he didn't turn right?
                   What if instead of going the road you're supposed to go, you kind of went that way?
                   And I've always been fascinated by that. I love Choose Your Own Adventure stories,
                   and things like that. I don't like following the written script. So that's one of
                   the reasons why I went into fix-it fics. There's times and places where I was like,
                   that wouldn't happen. I know that's how it happens in the story, but based on the
                   world that they're in, historical context, things like that, that's not how that
                   would. So, that's kind of my brain's way of reconciling not bad writing, but just
                   maybe inconsistent writing, or little things that were just irksome. That's kind of
                   how I got into that.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I chose Sansa in particular, and I
                   think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
                   little bit of character assassination.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted to kind of show a Sansa who was still herself.
                   A Sansa who was willing to not listen to him, who
                   understood that, this person is not my friend. This person is strictly
                   manipulative. He's going to take me somewhere that I don't want to go, so my
                   only choice is to find the strength in me that she has, and say, "Okay, I'll
                   run. If it means I have to die, I'm not going to let him use me for whatever his
                   ends are." That's kind of where that idea came from.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
                   of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
                   That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was another reason with the fic I kind of wanted to
                   delve a little bit into her as a standalone, not in relation to anyone else.
                   Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
                   away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
                   one thing that would be important to her? Because there aren't really a lot of
                   fics that focus on her as a character at all. She's just kind
                   of always at the side. That's kind of where I got the thing that is, I don't know
                   if I was a former slave. The one thing I
                   would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
                   in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
                   into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
                   anymore. And that's kind of how all that bloomed up. I'd really
                   like to see a bit more of that in Game of Thrones fanfiction. She's really an
                   underused character.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I adore the Dorne
                   storyline in the books, and they completely butchered it in the show. So, that's why
                   I
                   was like, no Dorne's way smarter than this. So yes, he's going to be the Dorne that
                   you
                   get in the books.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
                   agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
                   dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
                   that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
                   Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
                   we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
                   that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
                   her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
                   supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
                   that.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
                   beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
                   thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>

          <h2>Writer's Agency: Audience</h2>
          <div class="interview-search-analysis">
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors demonstrate an awareness of their audience and explain how they were thinking about their audience.</p>
          <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 34</p>
          <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Audience awareness when participating in fanfic genres is important not only so authors can actually reach their audience, but because they are often writing for themselves. When reflecting on who their ideal audiences are, Dialux, Gillywulf, and Valk each believe that their audience is — first and foremost — themselves. Dialux asks herself, “Well, what would I want to read?” Gillywulf says, “my audience should be myself.” Finally, Valk less explicitly says they want to “make [their fanfic] more relatable to me, but also to other people who might be reading this and wondering the same thing.” </p>
          <p>While imagined audiences for fanfic authors may begin at their own interests, they often publish so that others may also read their work. In order to reach their other ideal audiences, fan authors use specific tagging practices. AO3 provides fanfic authors with a multitude of options for self-reported tags, such as which characters are included, the relationships included, and “Additional Tags,” which are all the authors’ choices. These Additional Tags are particularly important, as authors make clear what fanfic genre they are participating in and include additional information. Writegirl mentions how important Additional Tags are, especially in the GOT fandom, as fans use these tags to discover and read their ideal fanfics. Using proper tagging practices and discourse will allow for authors to reach those readers. Dialux provides an example, too, of crossing over fandoms to reach potential readers who may not be actively looking for her piece. Since her fanfic is a GOT and <cite>Jodhaa Akbar</cite> crossover, she explains how she incorporated specific tags to reach a Hindu audience or an audience invested in Hindu culture and history. Finally, AO3 author-reported metadata can also be a place to provide specific trigger warnings. Aria mentions how she incorporated content warnings to avoid triggering her audience. This practice demonstrates a particular care for potential readers, putting their mental health first.</p>
          <p>Several of the fan authors also share potential tensions or fears in thinking about and reaching their audiences. Dialux expresses how she was worried about sharing her racebending fanfic because she wanted to be respectful to bother her own culture and regionally similar cultures. Specifically, she was worried, “Because I was also combining both South Indian and North Indian tropes, to a certain extent.” This fear came because she wanted to respect and celebrate her culture, but also knew about other racebent fanfics that had stereotyped particular races. The audience reaction to these fanfics demonstrates how harmful these racebent fics can be in that they may reinforce, rather than subvert, racist stereotypes or caricatures.</p>
          <p>Gillywulf also expresses discomfort in engaging with a particular genre, although she actively avoided participating in particular conventions of fanfic genres. Unlike racebending, other fanfic generic forms, such as slavefics, are almost always harmful. Gillywulf decided to set boundaries with prompts that requested particularly harmful generic forms by either refusing to participate or actively avoiding harmful conventions. For example, one person asked her to write a slavefic, but instead of writing a slavefic that romanticized the master/slave dynamic, Gillywulf removed all romance and focused on the need to actively speak out against racism and slavery.</p>
          <p>FFinally, Kittya’s own discomfort was less about harmful generic conventions or potentially triggering her audience. Her discomfort came from the fact that different circles in her personal life read her fanfics and she was not explicitly out yet to particular circles. In her fanfic, she hints at Asami and Korra’s romance in only one sentence as a way to both protect herself, but also signal to the slashfic community. Kittya says if she were to rewrite her piece, she would bring Korra and Asami’s romance to the forefront, but at the time, she had to navigate these two very different audiences — the community she was not yet out to and the slash community with whom she belonged. </p>

                   for a lot of people. But this, I think it was a good piece, it was a piece that was
                   a whole other world to read</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I had a very close group of friends on Live Journal back
                   in the early 2000s. That, I think, probably because I was a teenager. Perhaps this
                   is because of all those reasons. But that kind of close-knittedness has never kind
                   of shown up for me ever since. I think I tend to participate now on more, "Oh, this
                   is really interesting for me. And this is really fascinating." And I'll go into it
                   for the material as opposed to the friendships themselves.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because,
                   initially, it was definitely a very close-knit, just writing for friends and with
                   friends.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, the
                   person that I was supposed to be gifting to asked for a historical AU, alternate
                   universe, especially a middle aged one, with angst and a happy ending.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because I honestly expected nobody to do
                   that. It's good to see that people are just as interested in a lot of it, in this
                   stuff. You know?</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was really worried about how it
                   would be perceived by the fandom, how it would be received by people even outside
                   of
                   the fandom.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I was
                   really worried about it, actually. Because I spoke to a couple people before I
                   published the fanfic. Because I was kind of worried about it, and I wasn't sure how
                   it would be received.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I wasn't sure people would
                   think that it was good enough. Because I was also combining both South Indian and
                   North Indian tropes, to a
                   certain extent. And those weren't necessarily very compatible. And there's a lot
                   of history behind that and everything. And I wasn't entirely
                   sure how people would perceive it.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong> And I was so
                   worried. Because all of this was very close to my heart, and I did not want to have
                   to deal with a lot of backlash, or feedback, or having to fight to say, "Well, I
                   don't mean to be rude on any of these kinds of things." These are meant with respect
                   and they're meant with love. And they're from a part of myself.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, I initially wanted to make sure that it was pretty
                   clear to everyone that this was a canon divergence. Where one where Rhaegar has won,
                   Jon is raised a Targaryen.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And the reason I did the Jodhaa Akbar tag was actually
                   because I wanted to make sure that people who read more Hindu mythology fic, or
                   other fandoms like that, like Baahubali, were able to identify that this is one such
                   fic. And I think there are people who have said they've entered through that
                   particular tag.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Especially the quote that you put up here,
                   which refers to Sansa's eyes. Because that was a moment for me, I think, more than
                   anything else.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Oh. I think I learned that people are far more
                   understanding than I was giving them credit for, especially because I was so afraid
                   about the reception.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. Just, I wanted to get better at it, and people
                   were really good at giving me things that I could easily do at work,</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, my audience is pretty much just other fans like me, so it
                   was sort of just, "Well, what would I want to read? And what would people my age
                   think is fun?" Things like that. There were a couple people who regularly sent me
                   prompts, so it was sort of, I knew these were the sort of things they were into, or
                   I know what they're angling for in this question, in this idea. So, I'm like, "Okay,
                   I can sort of tailor it to that,"</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I know a lot of people like to have full sentences, and
                   get really detailed and say things like that, but I always find that to be sort of
                   distracting, because I know, when I'm personally looking for something, I like to
                   be
                   able to just click through until I find exactly what I'm looking for. So, if
                   somebody has what I'm looking for, but also in that same tag is a full sentence of
                   something else, it doesn't necessarily help me stuff. If somebody's specifically
                   looking for, I guess a long-distance relationship thing, they can just click on that
                   and see, "Okay, well, it's in here somewhere. I'll just find whichever prompt it
                   is." I'm a big fan of just keeping things neat and simple.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously a lot of it is trying to come up with
                   different ways to not use the same descriptions, not use the same words, because you
                   know that once you put it in the drabble, if you keep describing them the exact same
                   way, people might skip over that or it starts to start reading a little bit dull.
                   So, I tried to mix it up on occasion.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Things like that, you notice immediately, but also that
                   it's not necessarily always in a way that maybe the reader is expecting to see it.
                   I
                   don't know. It depends on each drabble, each specific one, and the mood that is also
                   trying to get portrayed.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's also, given the
                   audience, this is considered a family show. So, I realized over time that maybe I
                   don't have to write that.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>If you set those boundaries, people generally stick to
                   it. If you tell people flat out, "I'm not going to write that," they generally won't
                   press and press, and ask, "Why aren't you?" Because I just find keeping people as
                   slaves is super ... I didn't want to
                   contribute to it, and it was just that sort of idea
                   [inaudible 00:47:42] maybe are younger and a little bit
                   more impressionable than I am, so maybe it's okay to put things that they haven't
                   been exposed to before, but also, it doesn't need to be a weird
                   thing.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I learned to just not push it,
                   don't write what other people are demanding, necessarily.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>My audience should be myself, at the end of the day. I
                   want to write the things that I want to read. Even if I'd much rather prefer just
                   reading it and not having to put the time and effort into clacking my way through
                   it, if I want to read it, I have to write it sometimes, which is fine. But I should
                   enjoy the things that I'm writing.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It's just to be someone who builds and creates
                   with the purpose of fixing or making better, but then not being able to do so for
                   someone within your personal life. But the imagery also for that chapter was, I guess,
                   built in subtext because I wasn't
                   quite sure yet how to engage with what was happening in ways that were visible
                   to other people outside of the fan community, the slashfan
                   community.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> It has less to do with fandom
                   itself and more to do with the external world. And even now it's, I guess it's ...
                   I
                   don't know. I think it
                   just seemed like the safer option at the time.  But the more
                   time I've spent in that part of fandom, the less I guess I've cared about how it's
                   read or whatever it is. But at the time, it just seemed wiser, particularly if I was
                   having others who may not ... Because fan works and original work for me are on the
                   same level, and so I'm not concerned, I guess, with people reading it for ... people
                   reading it and not seeing a difference in quality, but rather how they experience
                   the content. And so I think I was still considering who the audience would
                   be.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Because there is this thing in fanfiction where we
                   assume that all people who are accessing it are familiar with the text. And while
                   that is often common when we want it to function beyond that world to have relevance
                   in other ways, I think for me personally it's important to integrate more parts of
                   the world, of the universe.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>For me, it was just reminding myself that, even though I'm
                   writing something where there are people who are familiar with the text, it's also
                   important to fill in the blanks sometimes.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It's
                   something that I wanted to, again, wanted to bring into a fanfic to kind of make it
                   more relatable to me, but also to other people who might be reading this and
                   wondering the same thing.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I think the strength is, I do try and keep it as much as
                   I can in character, and in situ, I guess. I don't like to pull too much of other
                   outside influences in. I think the strength is that people can read it and they can
                   really see it sliding into canon. And if you go into something aside, you don't have
                   to bump too much. And it would fit in the overall narrative.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>One
                   thing I noticed about the Game of Thrones fandom, because I did just kind of jump
                   in, is that tags are very important. I do read comments from other people in fics,
                   and that seems to be the one thing that everyone gripes about. This was tagged
                   unproperly. This should be the tag. The tag should be this. I was like, okay, let
                   me
                   try and tag as properly and nearly as I can, because I don't want to get dogpiled.
                   There's a lot of my favorite fics where there's 10 pages of people just ragging on
                   improper tagging. So I was like, nope, let me be careful.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Tags are hard because they are, it takes me...
                   The hardest part of my posting is tagging, to make sure that I have everything
                   right.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Ratings may change, warnings may change, series,
                   spoilers, all those kind of speak for themselves, just to let you know that okay,
                   once again, this isn't static. This is something that changes story by story. Some
                   of them may be Gen, some of them, I haven't written one yet, but some of them may
                   be
                   adult in the future. Some of them may have a lot of violence in them, so just be
                   aware. Don't ever come back to this fic and think, "This is what it is." Because
                   that's not it.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Out of character? I
                   never know. I think my
                   characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
                   "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
                   it may be out of character."</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Alternate universe, canon
                   divergence just to let people know, this isn't following canon, because I did not
                   want to get blasted on that one.</li>

            <h2>Writer's Agency: Research</h2>
            <div class="interview-search-analysis">
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors discuss forms of research they conducted while they were writing, including fan community research, reading about a theory, learning about language or history, and more.</p>
            <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 14</p>
            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Several fan authors share their research process, either how research they were doing at the time impacted their fanfics or how they researched for their fanfics. Dialux discusses doing research to better depict historical Indian culture and traditions. She is already familiar with some of these traditions, as they are part of her culture; she continues to research, though, as her fanfic focuses on history and she wanted to integrate some historical accuracy.</p>
            <p>Writegirl, Aria, Gillywulf, and Valk all discuss researching experiences that are not their own to more accurately represent these experiences. For example, Valk includes information about Jaime’s prosthetic hand, but since they do not have a prosthetic, they did a bit of research on the experience of using and taking care of one. Gillywulf also includes a story about Korra both a trans woman and a trans man in her vignette fanfics; Gillywulf is a cis woman, though, so she “drew knowledge” from trans communities on the internet.  Writegirl also did some research on the psychology of people who survive slavery and abuse to better understand both Missandei and Sansa’s perspectives. The integration of research allows fans to more accurately depict an experience they may not be personally familiar with as well as represent that experience as respectfully and accurately as possible.</p>

               <h3>Quotes</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I did consult with some folks when I was writing some texts about trauma, because
                     I was like... I wasn't comfortable writing that.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I would also say a little bit about some of the research I'd read at the time, turns
                     out the book I was reading at the time that claimed that knowing someone who was gay
                     had a significant...Or not knowing someone who was gay, but engaging with someone
                     who's gay on the topic of being gay helped significantly with changing someone's political
                     views, or being willing to accept gay people. Turns out that one was actually wrong,
                     like literally the person who put together that study cooked the book.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think that for
                     the actual research it was not so much that I did it for this particular fanfic, as
                     it was more that I love that era a lot. So, I had tended to research it before, as
                     well. So, I had a lot of information that I kind of knew in colloquial terms.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But I did
                     not remember the exact way that he had died, so then I kind of went searching for
                     that. And then, I mean, from there it kind of spiraled into researching other things
                     and kind of reading up more about Akbar and more about Jodhaa. And I'm an avid
                     research. I mean, that's what I do now.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think a lot of the research and a lot of the material
                     was just about identifying and pulling disparate ideas together that I knew.
                     From either my own culture because, of course,
                     this is partially my own culture. And also, the historical
                     details of [inaudible 00:27:49].</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I think that was what
                     was very important to me, especially in this story, was puling it all together so
                     that there weren't any open endings. And the research really, somehow, it helped in
                     pulling that together.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think that the
                     thing I wanted to keep in mind was that I was doing the research, but I was also not
                     putting as much research into it as I probably should have if I wanted to make it
                     historical fiction.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And that was one thing I wanted to be clear about.
                     Because, yes, it was research. But I think I wanted to keep to the spirit of the
                     movie, as well as the spirit of the A Song of Ice and Fire canon.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And even though the trans experience is not necessarily one
                     that I know for certain, there's plenty of people in the Korra community, in
                     most online Internet communities, where there's plenty of those people and you
                     see what they're going through and you see how their lives are,
                     and I try not to speak for situations that I've never lived through, but you can
                     draw knowledge from that and say, "Okay, well, without going in depth into feelings
                     or things like that, I can add this, this, and this, and make it maybe relatable in
                     that regard."</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>This is a topic
                     that I was a little bit hesitant to tackle because at the time, when I was writing,
                     I wasn't very well-versed in
                     not just having a limb missing as a disability, but also how advanced the
                     prosthetics were and if they could hold things. I did a little
                     bit of research while I was at Starbucks, trying to sort of complete
                     everything.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I learned a little bit, I actually had to do a bit of
                     research on some of the fic, for things like trauma, and how people respond to
                     trauma. Especially in the case of Sansa and Missandei, how do people overcome
                     certain difficulties after being in these different positions? That was a little bit
                     interesting. I did a little bit of in-depth on that, because once again, I'm that
                     nerd.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, mostly
                     it was Googling, recovering from trauma. I did a little bit of research on former
                     slaves, to see their mindset. That was a little bit what I did use for the mindset
                     of Missandei. Because people who've been in that situation, they go through, what
                     is
                     it called? No, goodness, I can't remember. But it was a very good article, and it
                     was talking about how former slaves, they go through this process of not believing
                     that they're free, and not believing that they're free, and not believing that
                     they're free. And eventually, they get to a
                     point where it sticks in their head, that this is freedom. This is what they
                     have. No one can control them. And then, they get very, very almost violently
                     independent, where no one's going to tell me what to do. You can't tell me what
                     to do. No one's going to do that to me. Once again, how some
                     people where to a much lesser extent, when you get out of controlling, overbearing
                     relationships, and then you're finally free, and you're like, "Fuck that shit. Where
                     am I going? I'm staying out all night. And I don't have to tell anybody."
                     They get this burst of a sense of self, a
                     sense of purpose. And I thought that was very beautiful, that there are people
                     who can go through all that type of trauma, and they can get there, and they can
                     fully bloom. And I always saw Missandei as kind of that character, this
                     character who had gone through all of that to the point where here she is,
                     standing tall as a character that knows her own worth, knows her own
                     personage.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then with Sansa, just how people recover
                     from abusive and traumatic relationships, and things like that. The stages of
                     recovery.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's one thing, to me, if it's too OOC, just out of
                     the block  there's no real change, and these drabbles are
                     so short. You can't really see a lot of character development from A to B.
                     Everything kind of has to fit where it does. So I wanted to make sure that it fit
                     and it wasn't too crazy. It's a lot of research.</li>

            <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 10</p>
            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Dialux, Valk, and Writegirl each share different drafting processes as they composed their fanfics or other pieces of writing. They each discuss a link between the drafting process and imagining the story before actually writing it down; there is a transfer of their thought process in imagining their fanfics to actually getting that fic written. Dialux shares how she conjures her fanfic plots and characters before putting them down on paper, and combs through these different ideas as she’s writing to make sure they are all implemented. This method demonstrates self-reflection as she drafts, explicitly thinking how what she writes captures what she imagined.</p>
            <p>Valk similarly shares how they imagined this story before writing. They mention they “had all these ideas and notes about what was also going on in the universe and what not” that they then wanted to translate into the actual fic. Specifically, they cite a fear of not being able to “put on paper” the fic they imagined. In order to actually write their fic, they challenged themself by writing the entire fanfic in one sitting at a coffee shop. When I ask what they learned from this fic, they joke, “never write an entire fanfic in Starbucks.”</p>
            <p>Finally, Writegirl also shares how she imagines an entire universe and plot lines with almost 200 pages of this reimagined GOT written. Similar to Valk, she also has notes and ideas written down, sometimes writing extensive scenes. The fanfics she chose to publish, though, are pivotal moments from these 200 pages of her long fanfic. She also expresses a desire to transfer her ideas onto the page, saying “I'm just going to take [the ideas] out and put you here [in the published fanfic], and then leave you alone.”</p>

               <h3>Quotes</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Mostly to keep
                     myself writing. Because, otherwise, I would just not publish those materials until
                     it becomes, you know. It's basically sitting on my hard drive for years and years
                     on
                     end, and finally I get the opportunity and the motivation to publish them.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But when I was making the
                     actual list of material, I basically just ran through from top to bottom of the
                     actual fanfic. And basically tried to remember everything that I thought about. And
                     identified the particular things that I was thinking about and trying to
                     identify.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because that's what I keep feeling whenever I look back at
                     it, was how I got almost consumed by the characters when I was writing them.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, I wrote it in
                     one sitting in a Starbucks near my university.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That, and also trying to write
                     and finish an entire fanfic in one sitting is very difficult when it's in a public
                     setting. Luckily, it happened and it was a nice exercise as well, just also to be
                     able to sit and write and have it really done in one sitting and then put it out
                     there was very satisfying.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I guess I wanted to
                     get a very powerful moment on paper. I had all these ideas and notes about what was
                     also going on in the universe and what not, but this was the one that kind of
                     started it. I wanted to make sure that I could get it down and not have it be that
                     fanfic that I write in my head and then I just cannot put on paper later on.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, so at the
                     same time I was writing this fanfic, I was writing another one that kind of delved
                     into the timeline of how Jaime grew up.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>The first big one
                     is never write an entire fanfic in Starbucks.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That I've actually
                     written about 200 pages for. But that was just the one pivotal scene. So I was like,
                     okay, I'm just going to take you out and put you here, and then leave you
                     alone.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's not done. It's not a solid 200 pages. I'm a very
                     chaotic writer, so I will get a bit of dialog in my head. I will see something, and
                     I will kind of write around that, and build around that, and string a bunch of
                     scenes. It's 200 pages, but it's 200 pages of broken up paragraphs, bits of dialog,
                     bits of scenery. So if I ever fleshed it out, it would be much longer, because I
                     have a problem containing myself.</li>

          <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors discuss the act of revising, or later stages in the writing process.</p>
          <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 5</p>
          <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Only two fan authors explicitly reflect on the revising process. Aria mentions how she shared her fanfic with a confidant to ensure she was representing trauma in a respectful, accurate manner. In fanfics, this is often referred to as beta-reading (or beta-ing), when a fan creator — either a fanfic author, comic artist, or other fan mediums — asks someone to look over their writing before they post it. Beta-reading can be anything from spelling and grammatical checks to providing larger feedback about the ideas and plotlines. Writegirl also explicitly mentions revising her piece, choosing to rewrite a scene that felt “superfluous.”</p>
          </div>

          <div class="interview-search-analysis">
             <h3>Quotes</h3>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I did consult with some folks when I was writing some texts about trauma, because
                   I was like... I wasn't comfortable writing that.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I also learned that you have to be careful with how much to take on, and you have
                   to be careful about what you're willing to prune, and you have to be ready to prune
                   things. And you have to be ready to follow a story where it goes instead of trying
                   to follow all the directions you ever imagined. Because if you try to follow a story
                   in every direction you have, then it's going to die like this piece did. It's like,
                   "I don't know how to integrate the story into itself anymore."</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I did a very brief
                   look over and then I was like, "Screw it,"</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>There's actually a lot more of that fic that is written
                   that didn't make it in. A whole thing where you get it from Nimeria's point of view
                   where you can see her. She's like, okay, just following to see what's going to
                   happen. And then when Sansa decides to run, that's when she decides to attack. But
                   I
                   thought that was a bit superfluous, so I took all of that out.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I have a lot of Game of Thrones stuff on the cutting
                   room floor, before I decided what to actually post. And there is about 20 other
                   drabbles for the one series that haven't made it yet, because I'm one of those
                   writers.</li>

          <h2>Writer's Agency: Reception</h2>
          <div class="interview-search-analysis">
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors directly mention reader feedback and how their writing was received.</p>
          <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 23</p>
          <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Fan authors each share experiences with positive and negative reception from their readers. Most of the fan authors receive supportive reception on their fanfic, from comments to other fans uptaking their work. Dialux expresses she was originally nervous to publish her fanfic, as racebending fanfics run the risk of reinscribing racist tropes if fan authors are not careful. Yet, she explains that she received nothing but positive feedback, and she hasn’t “gotten a single negative feedback on that fanfic to date.”</p>
          <p>Similarly, Writegirl shares positive reception she received on both her fanfic and other fanfics she published. Specifically, she points to one of the first reviews she ever received. Her reader “said they could taste the road dust from my writing.” Finally, Gillywulf also shares mainly positive feedback she received. Because her fanfic vignettes are direct uptakes of prompts her readers requested for her to write, most of her reception was fairly positive. For some of her vignettes, readers requested to see more of particular stories.</p>
          <p>As for negative reviews, Writegirl and Valk share specific negative comments they received. On Valk’s fanfic, which revolves around queer sexualities and genders, a reader began with a positive comment and then ended with the question “why in God's (capital G) name, did you make Jaime like this?” Valk points specifically to the “capital G” to demonstrate that the person reading the comment may be religious — Christian — which may explain why they critiqued Valk’s reimagining of Jaime’s gender. For Writegirl, she once had someone comment, “‘Fuck you, bastard’” on one of her fanfics. Writegirl cites this person as a troll and laughs off the comment.</p>

             <h3>Quotes</h3>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But that was the biggest bit of feedback I got was this conversation, and it helped
                   a little bit.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And that also came across to a lot of readers, is what
                   they were telling me, at least. Because they felt like there was a lot more gravitas
                   to the entire fic that you wouldn't see in a lot of my other
                   fanfics.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>But people were very kind about it. And I haven't
                   actually gotten a single negative feedback on that fanfic to date.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So, with all of that in mind, the actual fandom
                   response was absolutely wonderful, and absolutely, completely respectful. And none
                   of my fears at all came to fruition.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because they were all so kind, and so respectful of the entire fic in
                   general.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>There's been
                   a couple of fan artists over the years, like plastic-pipes, who is spectacular,
                   always great. And I think the name was [inaudible 00:11:19]
                   at the time, but I think they've changed it. There were a couple times when they did
                   art according to what I'd written, or things like that. And I was like, "Okay, well
                   it'd be cool if I wrote something that was specifically to get an image out of this
                   person's mind."</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I like that a lot of people, I still get comments
                   occasionally that are, "I've just gone through this whole thing," and you can do
                   that.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, if there were some things where I'd write the
                   original drabble, and then I might get three more immediate requests in my inbox for
                   a sequel, or for, "Can I get a full length thing of this?" And I didn't necessarily
                   have the time or energy, or just the inclination in some cases.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I mean, most
                   of it was positive, which was really good. If somebody really didn't like something,
                   they didn't usually tell me. Or if they did, sometimes it was like a spelling error
                   or a formatting error, and it'd be, "Okay, I can just easily fix that." I don't
                   think there were too many outright negative things. There was one. I don't think it
                   was on a prompt, but this artist I really liked at the time commented and said
                   something like, "This would've been better with this movie instead of the one you
                   actually used," and didn't necessarily anything positive otherwise. I don't know if
                   they actually liked it, or if it was just sort of a, "Well, I would've liked it
                   better if you'd done this thing the way I wanted you to." Which, it is what it is,
                   and you sort of have to just say, "Okay, well, this is the way I did it, and I'm not
                   going to change it." But it was definitely a situation where I was like, "Okay.
                   Don't know what to make of that."</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Most of the time, people are very, very happy about
                   it, because it was just another thing for them to read.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And
                   okay, well, when you meet somebody, what are the first things you
                   notice? And for Korra, she's an imposing
                   figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles,
                   she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
                   Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes. So, those
                   things stand out immediately.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it's okay that maybe only three other people
                   also liked it, but I like it.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, I got a very
                   interesting response from someone. I believe, maybe a week or two after. They were
                   like, "It's a really well written fanfic, it's great, but why in God's (capital G)
                   name, did you make Jaime like this?" And the moment I saw capital G, I was like I
                   see. I tried to be as cordial as I could and I explained what I said earlier about
                   my inspiration</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Yeah, that was the one big kick
                   back I got from someone. I was a little bit shocked that I got the capital G person,
                   but what can you do?</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then that's when I kind of got feedback, because the
                   first fanfic, I never got any feedback from anyone. I was just like, "Oh, I'm
                   shouting into the dark." So yeah, it kind of changed, and it got me a bit more
                   active, and like, people actually want to say something about it. What did you think
                   about it? I started getting a bit more communication, a bit more activity.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And someone wrote a really detailed review, just about
                   how, I remember they said they could taste the road dust from my writing. And I was
                   like, wow. I never thought of it that way. That's really cool. That kind of inspired
                   me to write more, that I could get that emotion out of somebody. They felt like they
                   were actually there with them.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I've had a
                   couple requests from the other ones. They're like, "I would love to read this
                   story." I'm like, "No, you don't understand. It's a lot to wade
                   through."</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>The
                   "What if" tag was very important, because I've had that on fanfiction.net before.
                   People are like, "You should have tagged it as an AU." I'm like, "But it is. It's
                   right there." So I had the "What if."</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Out of character? I
                   never know. I think my
                   characters are pretty in character, but there's always the one person who's like,
                   "This character would never do that." So I'm just like, "Okay. Just to let you know,
                   it may be out of character."</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But there are people who
                   they're really willing to engage with you, and they have questions. In a lot of
                   other fandoms, some people are just like, "This is a nice story." Game of Thrones
                   fans will have questions for you in the comments. They'll be like, "What about this?
                   And what about this? Oh, what about this? What do you think about this?" It's fun
                   to
                   get that dialog. That's something I never had before.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>In one of my other fics, there's the Deviant Lord. We
                   will run out of the character requirement, talking to each other back and forth in
                   comments about things.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually
                   had one troll who just wrote, "Fuck you, you bastard." And I was like, yes. I was
                   just like, "Whoa. Okay. I'm sorry you're having such a bad day. Go have a mimosa.
                   Just don't take it out on me."</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>But
                   there are just people who are just nasty. In all the fandoms I've been in, it
                   thankfully hasn't happened to me yet, and I've actually had people defend me in
                   comments. They're just like, "Get that shit out of here." I'm like, "Okay, thank you
                   for being nice." But it seems the Game of Thrones fandoms can get real violent. They
                   get real virulent with their hatred in the comments section. I can't muster that
                   kind of hatred. If I don't like something, I just click off of it. I don't get the
                   hate.</li>

             <h3>Quotes</h3>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Some of the pieces I wrote just no longer work as Homestuck pieces because the characters
                   have been changed, and I was like, "I can't really write this story about two women
                   in love because one of them isn't a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
                   context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
                   very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
                   you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
                   original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
                   through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
                   and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
                   with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
                   get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
                   you.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so
                   I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And
                   already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They
                   weren't things I was writing about at the time.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters.
                   I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short,
                   but it felt more like a nod than a full</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong> There are things I don't like about it, but I like it as a little bit of text. It's
                   there in the text, it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love
                   feeling represented." So I wrote that.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
                   a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
                   different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
                   in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
                   and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
                   looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think of a place I was there, and this was particularly...I was engaging with political
                   institutions at the time that were much, much bigger than me, particularly family
                   institutions. My family was pretty chill, but running a queer resource center at community
                   college is like, getting that [inaudible 00:24:12]. You would deal with a bunch of
                   people that were writing about the problems for being gay, or feeling like they can't
                   talk about it, or being the only source of information, of being part of an institution
                   that was the only source of information.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
                   a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
                   but it's good.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think the redo of the relationship, the exploration is limited, is kind of bad.
                   But I also think that the way that we end somewhere where it's like, they just want
                   to be married, or at the end of their first date, we did see them agree, yeah I want
                   to do this. Yeah, I want to have this, or I like this, it's healthy. I love that!
                   I just see that as a lot of things for writers to engage with.[inaudible 00:47:08]
                   what are other ways we can imagine it?</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So then I realized that Jodhaa Akbar, which is
                   definitely a Desi film, had a wonderful set of characters that was definitely
                   angsty, but had a wonderfully happy ending. And allowed me to write about something
                   that was kind of dear to my heart as well. Because it was a Desi film. It was one
                   representation in a way, but not necessarily. I think it was just about freeing
                   those religious tensions, and those cultural tensions, and actually attempting
                   to bridge them. Because you have to. Because it's not just
                   about love, or it's not just about anything. It's about your pride, it's about your
                   family's livelihood. All of those kind of come together, you have to do it. You
                   don't want to, but, somehow, you have to. I think it's that gritting of your teeth,
                   and getting on with life that kind of really draws me in.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean that I just don't think I relate to him at the
                   same extent that I relate to Sansa.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think if you look at A Song of Ice and Fire, technically,
                   more than Game of Thrones, you
                   actually get more of a cultural tension due to just the difference between the
                   North and the South. And all of that. And I do think that George R. R. Martin
                   has kind of perpetuated the idea, simply because he is English. So, the whole
                   idea that in England, where Northerners are tougher and everything than
                   Southerners. And I don't know anything more about it. But I think that's kind of
                   one of the underlying and unconscious biases within the framework of the
                   canon.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, obviously, Season Eight was terrible.
                   That was a given. And the ending did not do anyone any favors.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And second of all, the actual TV show was not doing itself any
                   favors. </li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yeah, I mean, I think
                   when I was first getting into the fandom,
                   one of my friends basically told me that the women in this are really
                   strong. And it's true to a great extent. But I think what's
                   even more fascinating to me, is how a lot of them tend to show that strength in so
                   many different ways. Like, you have Sansa, who
                   is conventionally pretty, but she also has, on an internal level, she just kind
                   of lives with whatever society expects of her. Whereas, Brienne is not
                   conventionally pretty, so she has to find another way of gaining power in her
                   world. And then you have people like Margaery Tyrell and Cersei
                   Lannister,</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I actually do remember how unhappy people were that Sansa didn't
                   end with a love interest at the end of Season Eight.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I
                   think it's just a relief to see how... Because to me, it's almost like a moment of
                   such growth, is what I felt, when I felt Sansa. Because when you're young,
                   [inaudible 01:20:56]. You want the perfect marriage, and
                   the perfect husband, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But that doesn't mean that
                   you'll necessarily get it. And to me, at least, growing up is balancing those
                   childhood desires, and those childhood needs with whatever you learn as you grow up.
                   And Sansa, despite the fact that as a young
                   child she wanted all of that, in the end she got power, and the ability to make
                   sure that nobody hurt her.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I think
                   there are other ways that the show actually showed that with the sexual
                   liberation for women, and the feminist liberation for Arya and
                   everything.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And, obviously, there's a ton of other problems. How [inaudible
                   01:21:42] Daenerys, and Cersei, and Jaime. And a number of other characters.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I could understand why people felt unhappy about it. But at the same time, I
                   think you're beating on the wrong bush here. There's a lot of other problems to deal
                   with within this fandom. And within this canon that we don't particularly need as
                   much as you're putting into it.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
                   very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
                   queer
                   characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
                   go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
                   their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
                   situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I started in college and I had watched most of Avatar, but I
                   don't think I ever quite finished it. And I think this was just before season three
                   came out, I want to say. I'm not totally 100% on that. But my roommate was very much
                   into that, very much in love with Avatar, so she was appalled that I don't think I'd
                   ever finished Avatar, and made me watch that.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"Okay, well, let's just do Korra next," because I was pretty sure
                   that came out. So, we ended up watching that. And then, once we built a routine out
                   of, "Okay, we're both back from class, we're watching this episode now," and it sort
                   of became part of our schedule that, once we both got back from that class, we'd
                   watch an episode. It was a good way to become emotionally invested in it.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I was very much endeared by the way Korra was super honest,
                   and her character in general, and how she was just trying her best, and just the art
                   style and everything about her character design I loved, and her personality.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And then, just
                   seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
                   once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
                   not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
                   the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
                   there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
                   </li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
                   super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
                   of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
                   relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
                   should take five steps back, and let's just
                   focus on these two.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> That was
                   Christmas break, but my grandma was staying over for the weekend, so I had to watch
                   it silently at like midnight, and freak out quietly. As soon as Asami showed up on
                   the screen, I must have lost
                   it. But it was incredible. I couldn't believe it. I was like, "This is
                   happening, right?" Yeah. I was like, "Jesus."</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I loved that. Even if, and I think
                   once Korra sort of got over herself, she started to feel that way about Asami,
                   maybe. It's because of the whole rivalry thing. Initially, it was definitely harder
                   to see
                   that, but I liked that they
                   weren't immediate, for the most part.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
                   it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
                   since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
                   until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
                   a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
                   decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
                   this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
                   case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
                   Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
                   bit.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
                   was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
                   possible love interests.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, we spend four seasons developing
                   Korra and Asami's relationship from maybe rivals, to best friends, to they're
                   lovers, the relationship that they end on. And it's super great to see that fleshed
                   out</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, to
                   see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
                   god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
                   have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it was also good that
                   nobody in that show was white, by definition. When you look at where those
                   communities are meant to be, have drawn inspiration from, nobody in that is
                   white, so it's even more exciting, and it's great, and we need more of that,
                   frankly.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>That was an Indian television show that I was
                   watching, and I happened to be looking for ways to continue to consume the show
                   because I'd been watching it back home, but back home I had English subtitles
                   and so on.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>At the
                   time that the show was airing, it was kind of taboo for
                   divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare for a widower to be
                   portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife that he had lost, so
                   it was a combination of really interesting things.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And because I grew up in a country
                   where we have a large Indo-Guyanese population, so Indian content was part of our
                   regular air waves and the music and sound that we listened, so it shaped what I was
                   interested in.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But I
                   think with Twilight it was just that phase where you finally find a
                   story that speaks to you, even if you kind of hate it when you look back at it when
                   you're older. But at the time, how
                   Bella was written both as someone who was insular and chooses to form or has a
                   small community and so forth and deals with depression or
                   whatever it is, it just seemed to be something that I could relate to. And so
                   I was both interested in that, and I guess in the power fantasy that she was written
                   to
                   come in to. Usually, at least for me at the time, it wasn't really common to see those
                   characters have that kind of a glow-up, you can say.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think it was more
                   that it was very books for me because I grew up in the Caribbean ... Well, on
                   South America but as socially, politically part of the Caribbean, so most of the
                   content that we were consuming was either shows from the US or whatever, maybe
                   European shows might have filtered through, and that also was the case for the
                   books that we were reading. And while it was the case within school for us to
                   consume Caribbean literature, it was harder to read Caribbean literature as a
                   person on my own.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So it was just discovering a collection of books in my
                   own home from my aunt and my mother and so on, their teachers. And my aunt in particular,
                   she
                   teaches English, and so they had old texts that I found and started reading
                   them. And that's when I began to realize that the books that I had been reading
                   were excluding me. It was something that you sort of knew but you didn't quite
                   know. I guess it comes back to not knowing what you're missing
                   until you finally have it. So when I first read texts were people
                   were actually talking about foods that I would eat or where people were living
                   in communities like mine, where people spoke that way that I spoke, et
                   cetera.
                   Because even though I speak, let's say,
                   like this, how I speak with my family or how I speak with my friends from back
                   home, it's a little different even though ... So, my particular country, we
                   speak English, but it's a particular kind of English. So just
                   seeing that in text and then realizing that the fantasies and so on that I was
                   consuming were ... I don't know, it had these strange things that just didn't quite
                   compute with where I was living. That's where it really clicked for me. And from
                   that point onward, I think that's where I began to see it in everything else. The
                   biggest shift didn't really come until I moved to the US, because back home I was
                   part of the
                   majority, so even though it's absent, you were still seeing yourself in other
                   ways, whether that's being who was teaching you or who was in the news as a
                   politician, et cetera. But here it was a completely different
                   ballgame, so it felt more insidious</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
                   was on Twitter casually scrolling through something, and someone from back home
                   happened to mention how the finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background
                   and
                   the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
                   that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
                   Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
                   I
                   could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
                   been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
                   how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With the case of Asami and her father, I think it just
                   came back to how they wrote the final book for the series. I found it fascinating
                   that Asami had reached out to her father after what had happened.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think
                   in the first two books, even though Korra does have moments of vulnerability, I
                   guess her experiences are fantastical in a sense.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It was sort of ... To me,
                   it was groundbreaking in how they handled that because we get to see Korra, who is
                   this all-powerful person, come to grips with what she might be like after having
                   this really terrible thing happen to her and want sort of responsibilities she once
                   had, and how it's still there, but she has all these other things she now has to
                   deal with as well, like her mental health and her physical recovery and so
                   forth.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I don't know, it just ... There may have been
                   other works of fiction that never really covered that, but for me in particular that
                   was when Korra just seemed more human.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Korra gets to her lowest point.  The implication is that she's about to jump off a
                   cliff. But
                   we don't really get to dwell in the true feeling of that moment, the have to fix
                   it immediately because of the idea that the show may never get to come back to
                   this point, so we don't get to actually see what that means for
                   her.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>we see Korra actual deal, for more than one episode, with how
                   she's effected by these things, and to me that was different.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>You actually get to see an
                   avatar. And yes, Aang did deal with this too, but it's ... I don't know.
                   It's just different for me.
                   Deal with PTSD and depression and just all these changing
                   things. It was interesting.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>everyone has seen someone who they think is
                   all-powerful and infallible, invulnerable to an extent, be ... I don't want to say
                   broken, but be injured in a
                   really drastic way and them not being able to do anything much to help with her
                   recovery in concrete ways.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think
                   it's just existing personally as a marginalized person. The way that that storyline
                   was handled in LOK, I think I wasn't quite comfortable with it, just the very idea
                   of the movement disappearing because of one man's end. It seems so unrealistic
                   because there was a real situation with inequality there. Because we see that the
                   world has adapted to cater for benders, and we don't quite know non-benders are
                   faring in that world, what kind of opportunities they're having. And based on the
                   conflict that the show raised, it was clear that non-benders were in a position
                   where they weren't having ends meet or they weren't getting the jobs that they hoped
                   to get.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>The universe raises really
                   interesting conversations about inequality and power and change and so forth, but
                   we
                   kind of always see it from the position of the privileged. And I think that's my favorite
                   thing about fandom
                   and fan fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that
                   either there wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important
                   enough to explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always
                   in the forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the
                   world," not just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
                   through.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With gender roles in particular,
                   I think it's fascinating that within the Avatar universe, we got to see all
                   these really powerful girl and women characters who were, for the most part,
                   respected, at least in later years. Because when we first meet
                   the Avatar world, we know that for a fact Azula isn't ... Even though Azula has all
                   this power, she's in this position where she could eventually have the throne, she
                   isn't respected by her own father.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But even Katara in the beginning, it was kind of frowned upon for her to use
                   waterbending beyond healing, and she goes on to become one of
                   the greatest waterbenders the world has ever known. And we even get to see her have
                   this really powerful but terrifying and concerning moments where she bloodbends
                   someone who is, up until that point, we assume more powerful than her and more
                   ruthless and so forth. So it was
                   interesting to see all these female characters get to be complex and powerful
                   and not have that held against them, unless you count Azula and
                   how that ended for her.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But it was nice to see the LOK universe expand
                   upon that and show us that things had changed in some ways. For one, we have Korra,
                   who is the avatar, and she is this
                   figure who is not the conventional or gender-conforming version of femininity
                   that we're accustomed to. She's allowed to be athletic and walk around in pants
                   without concerns about what others are thinking. Even though she does think
                   about her gender presentation, it comes from a place that's not her considering
                   herself inadequate, but because she saw other people I guess idolized in this
                   particular form of femininity being expressed, so we see Korra and we see Lin
                   and we see Sue and Kuvira, and they're all these women who either have power or
                   they're dealing with their own traumas or they have complex relationships with
                   their mothers, and they have complex relationships with their children as well,
                   if they do have children, and so forth. I don't know. It was an
                   example of how that world had changed or was changing possibly for the
                   better.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I'm
                   like, "In what world am I supposed to view this as platonic? I mean, I know I was
                   raised
                   in a pretty fundamentalist Christian kind of environment, but I think I'm seeing
                   here things that I should not be seeing between two [inaudible
                   00:58:53] people." So that's when I became a
                   believer. And the longer I watched the show, the more it seemed to grow.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And
                   you could tell, from a fandom perspective, some people who are cishet won't be able
                   to speak to
                   this, but you could tell that the writer's room was split in
                   how they were portraying the characters because I think they got uncomfortable with
                   how fandom
                   was growing so rapidly and intensely around these two
                   characters, even
                   to the point where they used the black character as a wedge between
                   them. So, just so many layers of so many awful things happening
                   in that show. </li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But we basically had these two
                   actors leaning into it because they didn't have a problem with
                   it, but we see that some of the writers were
                   uncomfortable, or I guess maybe the network or the showrunners were
                   uncomfortable where the story was heading. And so they moved
                   away from what was organically developing to the extent where they took two
                   characters who never said more than a single word to each other, and one of these
                   characters actively disliked the other character, and said, "Hey, we're going to
                   have these two put together. And we are
                   going to have your favorite superhero be shipped with a slave
                   owner. So, yay, have fun with that."</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So
                   when you start off with a show that has ... It's basically girl-next-door, blonde,
                   blue-eyed, sort of
                   hyper-feminine in some ways but also gender non-conforming in other ways super
                   hero dating a
                   black man, or having that black man being put as a love interest when that's
                   usually not the case, especially for that kind of media.
                   And then you break them apart in the
                   second season and conveniently replace him with a white man who just actually
                   makes the character feel terrible and derails her show, and starts to get almost as
                   much screen
                   time as she does even though he's not really an integral part of the show. Just
                   so much went wrong so fast. He was so bad.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I just find their relationship in
                   canon to be so interesting because it was one of
                   the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
                   pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
                   surprised.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Brienne was what a lot of
                   these men might be experiencing in that they might just be funneled through to these
                   places that they don't actually feel, you know like they've done all the checklists
                   and stuff, but you still won't be happy doing it. And I think that reflected a lot
                   of her issues with not being able
                   to fulfill the role that she was supposed to play with her father with being the
                   heir, giving him a son and all these things. And there might be
                   always that wonder in the back of her head, like what would have happened if I'd
                   gone down that path and Jaime is the answer to it and he's miserable</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>even in the context of like the canon,
                   he always had a very strange affinity, but
                   like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
                   loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point
                   of view.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of recreate the feelings that I had when I was
                   reading Jaime and Brienne in their notorious bath house scene. Where this was this
                   very raw moment where Jaime opened up and did his monologue about a knight's duty
                   and how it was, pardon my language, full of shit.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>as like a side note, I think the show really undercut Jaime and Brienne's
                   relationship as well at the end. One of the big ones is like Jaime and Brienne
                   kissed each other and Jaime was suddenly taller than her. I was
                   like, "Boy is a head shorter than her."</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That was part of the appeal was that Jaime had this big, beautiful wife that was taller
                   than him
                   and he's like, "Look at my beautiful wife. Isn't she huge, ask him, and
                   wonderful?" That was part of what made it so enjoyable</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think that bit of the
                   ending, was actually the one I had the least amount of problems with, out of all of
                   it because its part of the King's guard. This was like an ideal kind of took Jaime's
                   spot in like the head.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I mean, personally, I think the whole bit where he leaves and comes
                   back is bullshit. Like, I'm sorry, I can't even mince words with that</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That would have been a good way to end it, not, we're going to hug
                   each other and we're going to let some rocks fall.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I knew everything that was going to
                   happen until about Season Four. And was perfectly happy with it, really wasn't
                   paying any attention.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
                   Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
                   Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
                   no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
                   brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
                   thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
                   wrote a Game of Thrones fanfiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
                   series, the first one.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I chose Sansa in particular, and I
                   think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
                   little bit of character assassination.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong> So seeing that, and kind of juxtaposing it against the Sansa
                   we were getting in the show was a little irksome.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I literally got up off the couch and walked away when
                   she got beheaded. I was very upset. It pissed me
                   off that you have a character like Missandei who is very strong, who survives
                   slavery, got out of her chains, became this person who was herself, and then how
                   did she die? She dies in chains, basically in a pissing contest between two
                   white women. That was very, very frustrating and irritating to
                   me.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That seemed completely out of
                   character for me. The whole scene was out of character for me.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
                   of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
                   That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I adore the Dorne
                   storyline in the books, and they completely butchered it in the show. So, that's why
                   I
                   was like, no Dorne's way smarter than this. So yes, he's going to be the Dorne that
                   you
                   get in the books.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Which was a twist I desperately wanted to happen in the show
                   that didn't happen, and I was a little upset about that</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Missandei deserved
                   better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
                   they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
                   would. And then, [inaudible 00:24:23].</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
                   agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
                   dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
                   that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
                   Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
                   we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
                   that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
                   her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
                   supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
                   that.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
                   beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
                   thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually liked
                   Sandor Clegane, Sansa Stark as a pairing, whether it's through platonic, whether
                   it's romantic, et cetera. It was just one of those good ones. I thought they had
                   good scene chemistry together. I always thought he kind of saw her,
                   especially in the beginning as, he called her a little bird. Like, "I see that your
                   parents never prepared you for this. Your best safe kept in a cage locked away, and
                   you
                   can just sing to people." I always liked that about him.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, there's one scene where he kind of corners her,
                   and it's a lot of Chester the Molester, a bit. It's a little
                   stalker-y.</li>

            <h2>Canon Compliment</h2>
            <div class="interview-search-analysis">
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors compliment the canonical material, including its writing, ideologies, identity representation, and more.</p>
            <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 29</p>
            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> All six of the fan authors share characters, moments, or identity representation that made them fall in love with and feel connected to the shows. These compliments are not necessarily about what the show did technically well, but how each fan developed an emotional investment with the show.</p>
            <p>For fans of both TLOK and GOT, each author expresses excitement for different forms of representation that resist normative notions of gender and sexuality. For example, the final episode of TLOK, when Korra/Asami’s romantic relationship—and thus bisexuality— is confirmed canon, resonates with Aria and Gillywulf. Gillywulf describes elation, saying, “But it was incredible. I couldn't believe it. I was like, ‘This is happening, right?’ Yeah. I was like, ‘Jesus.’” Gillywulf’s excitement in this final episode appears across her and the other TLOK fans’ interviews. In both TLOK and GOT, authors point to the canon resisting gender norms as another reason they love the shows. Several authors describe how different characters oppose gender stereotypes. For instance, from the GOT authors, Dialux cites she was originally drawn to the show because she heard it portrayed “strong women.”</p>
            <p>Valk interprets Jaime and Brienne as characters who do not conform to gender norms, saying Jaime has an “affinity for feminity.” Valk also points to this non-conformity as one of the reasons they ship them: “That was part of the appeal was that Jaime had this big, beautiful wife that was taller than him and he's like, "Look at my beautiful wife. Isn't she huge..and wonderful?” Valk specifically points to Brienne’s size in comparison to Jaime’s as one of the reasons Valk loves their characters. As for TLOK, Kittya argues that pretty much every woman from both TLOK and <cite>Avatar: The Last Airbender</cite> is well-developed and strong. Korra particularly, as Kittya describes, “is not the conventional or gender-conforming version of femininity that we're accustomed to.” Korra is muscular, physically powerful, can be sarcastic, and has a firey temper. Yet, the show's writers allow her to be vulnerable and make mistakes.</p>
            <p>The fan authors’ love and compliments for the canon is often tied to characters, specifically how each author interprets characters’ representations as resisting normativity.</p>

             <h3>Quotes</h3>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose Korra and Asami because they're main characters, I like writing main characters.
                   I liked the love story, it was kind of short in the text, but I liked it. Or not short,
                   but it felt more like a nod than a full</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
                   a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
                   but it's good.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think the redo of the relationship, the exploration is limited, is kind of bad.
                   But I also think that the way that we end somewhere where it's like, they just want
                   to be married, or at the end of their first date, we did see them agree, yeah I want
                   to do this. Yeah, I want to have this, or I like this, it's healthy. I love that!
                   I just see that as a lot of things for writers to engage with.[inaudible 00:47:08]
                   what are other ways we can imagine it?</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Yeah, I mean, I think
                   when I was first getting into the fandom,
                   one of my friends basically told me that the women in this are really
                   strong. And it's true to a great extent. But I think what's
                   even more fascinating to me, is how a lot of them tend to show that strength in so
                   many different ways. Like, you have Sansa, who
                   is conventionally pretty, but she also has, on an internal level, she just kind
                   of lives with whatever society expects of her. Whereas, Brienne is not
                   conventionally pretty, so she has to find another way of gaining power in her
                   world. And then you have people like Margaery Tyrell and Cersei
                   Lannister,</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I
                   think it's just a relief to see how... Because to me, it's almost like a moment of
                   such growth, is what I felt, when I felt Sansa. Because when you're young,
                   [inaudible 01:20:56]. You want the perfect marriage, and
                   the perfect husband, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But that doesn't mean that
                   you'll necessarily get it. And to me, at least, growing up is balancing those
                   childhood desires, and those childhood needs with whatever you learn as you grow up.
                   And Sansa, despite the fact that as a young
                   child she wanted all of that, in the end she got power, and the ability to make
                   sure that nobody hurt her.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I think
                   there are other ways that the show actually showed that with the sexual
                   liberation for women, and the feminist liberation for Arya and
                   everything.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"Okay, well, let's just do Korra next," because I was pretty sure
                   that came out. So, we ended up watching that. And then, once we built a routine out
                   of, "Okay, we're both back from class, we're watching this episode now," and it sort
                   of became part of our schedule that, once we both got back from that class, we'd
                   watch an episode. It was a good way to become emotionally invested in it.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I was very much endeared by the way Korra was super honest,
                   and her character in general, and how she was just trying her best, and just the art
                   style and everything about her character design I loved, and her personality.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> That was
                   Christmas break, but my grandma was staying over for the weekend, so I had to watch
                   it silently at like midnight, and freak out quietly. As soon as Asami showed up on
                   the screen, I must have lost
                   it. But it was incredible. I couldn't believe it. I was like, "This is
                   happening, right?" Yeah. I was like, "Jesus."</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I loved that. Even if, and I think
                   once Korra sort of got over herself, she started to feel that way about Asami,
                   maybe. It's because of the whole rivalry thing. Initially, it was definitely harder
                   to see
                   that, but I liked that they
                   weren't immediate, for the most part.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, we spend four seasons developing
                   Korra and Asami's relationship from maybe rivals, to best friends, to they're
                   lovers, the relationship that they end on. And it's super great to see that fleshed
                   out</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, to
                   see this cartoon suddenly become canon, against a network that had super tried to,
                   god, just tear it apart, it was invigorating, to say the least. Yeah. That's why I
                   have to imagine people took off with it.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And it was also good that
                   nobody in that show was white, by definition. When you look at where those
                   communities are meant to be, have drawn inspiration from, nobody in that is
                   white, so it's even more exciting, and it's great, and we need more of that,
                   frankly.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>At the
                   time that the show was airing, it was kind of taboo for
                   divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare for a widower to be
                   portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife that he had lost, so
                   it was a combination of really interesting things.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
                   was on Twitter casually scrolling through something, and someone from back home
                   happened to mention how the finale of the show had gone.  Given my own cultural background
                   and
                   the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
                   that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show ...
                   Sorry, not reading the show, but watching the show to get through it to see ... If
                   I
                   could see where it was going and if I would be as surprised as everyone else had
                   been. So when I got through the show, I was surprised, and I was really happy about
                   how it had gone. I felt a need to contribute to the fandom in some way.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With the case of Asami and her father, I think it just
                   came back to how they wrote the final book for the series. I found it fascinating
                   that Asami had reached out to her father after what had happened.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It was sort of ... To me,
                   it was groundbreaking in how they handled that because we get to see Korra, who is
                   this all-powerful person, come to grips with what she might be like after having
                   this really terrible thing happen to her and want sort of responsibilities she once
                   had, and how it's still there, but she has all these other things she now has to
                   deal with as well, like her mental health and her physical recovery and so
                   forth.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>we see Korra actual deal, for more than one episode, with how
                   she's effected by these things, and to me that was different.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With gender roles in particular,
                   I think it's fascinating that within the Avatar universe, we got to see all
                   these really powerful girl and women characters who were, for the most part,
                   respected, at least in later years. Because when we first meet
                   the Avatar world, we know that for a fact Azula isn't ... Even though Azula has all
                   this power, she's in this position where she could eventually have the throne, she
                   isn't respected by her own father.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But even Katara in the beginning, it was kind of frowned upon for her to use
                   waterbending beyond healing, and she goes on to become one of
                   the greatest waterbenders the world has ever known. And we even get to see her have
                   this really powerful but terrifying and concerning moments where she bloodbends
                   someone who is, up until that point, we assume more powerful than her and more
                   ruthless and so forth. So it was
                   interesting to see all these female characters get to be complex and powerful
                   and not have that held against them, unless you count Azula and
                   how that ended for her.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But it was nice to see the LOK universe expand
                   upon that and show us that things had changed in some ways. For one, we have Korra,
                   who is the avatar, and she is this
                   figure who is not the conventional or gender-conforming version of femininity
                   that we're accustomed to. She's allowed to be athletic and walk around in pants
                   without concerns about what others are thinking. Even though she does think
                   about her gender presentation, it comes from a place that's not her considering
                   herself inadequate, but because she saw other people I guess idolized in this
                   particular form of femininity being expressed, so we see Korra and we see Lin
                   and we see Sue and Kuvira, and they're all these women who either have power or
                   they're dealing with their own traumas or they have complex relationships with
                   their mothers, and they have complex relationships with their children as well,
                   if they do have children, and so forth. I don't know. It was an
                   example of how that world had changed or was changing possibly for the
                   better.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I just find their relationship in
                   canon to be so interesting because it was one of
                   the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
                   pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
                   surprised.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Brienne was what a lot of
                   these men might be experiencing in that they might just be funneled through to these
                   places that they don't actually feel, you know like they've done all the checklists
                   and stuff, but you still won't be happy doing it. And I think that reflected a lot
                   of her issues with not being able
                   to fulfill the role that she was supposed to play with her father with being the
                   heir, giving him a son and all these things. And there might be
                   always that wonder in the back of her head, like what would have happened if I'd
                   gone down that path and Jaime is the answer to it and he's miserable</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>even in the context of like the canon,
                   he always had a very strange affinity, but
                   like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
                   loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point
                   of view.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of recreate the feelings that I had when I was
                   reading Jaime and Brienne in their notorious bath house scene. Where this was this
                   very raw moment where Jaime opened up and did his monologue about a knight's duty
                   and how it was, pardon my language, full of shit.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That was part of the appeal was that Jaime had this big, beautiful wife that was taller
                   than him
                   and he's like, "Look at my beautiful wife. Isn't she huge, ask him, and
                   wonderful?" That was part of what made it so enjoyable</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think that bit of the
                   ending, was actually the one I had the least amount of problems with, out of all of
                   it because its part of the King's guard. This was like an ideal kind of took Jaime's
                   spot in like the head.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I knew everything that was going to
                   happen until about Season Four. And was perfectly happy with it, really wasn't
                   paying any attention.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually liked
                   Sandor Clegane, Sansa Stark as a pairing, whether it's through platonic, whether
                   it's romantic, et cetera. It was just one of those good ones. I thought they had
                   good scene chemistry together. I always thought he kind of saw her,
                   especially in the beginning as, he called her a little bird. Like, "I see that your
                   parents never prepared you for this. Your best safe kept in a cage locked away, and
                   you
                   can just sing to people." I always liked that about him.</li>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors describes how they relate or do not relate to texts.</p>
            <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 18</p>
            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> As both the canon compliment and the canon critique quotes show, fan authors’ relation to canon materials is usually tied to how their lived experiences are or are not represented in a text. Aria explicitly says, “Oh, I love this, I love feeling represented,” as part of her motivation for writing a TLOK fanfic, specifically in reference to Korra and Asami’s confirmed relationship and bisexuality. Gillywulf builds off Aria’s point, citing the TLOK fan community and writing fanfic as a way to explore different coming out situations. She says “so, I had decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, ‘It could be this, or it could be that.’” Through her 400-chapter-long fanfiction and other ways of interacting with TLOK fandom, she prepared herself to come out, hoping her story would be one of acceptance.</p>
            <p>As Gillywulf and Aria describe relating to the queer representation in TLOK, Dialux and Kittya point to how representations of their cultures drew them into specific texts. Dialux and Kittya both talk about texts different from GOT and TLOK, but they still brought up their cultural contexts. Dialux decided to write a fanfic about GOT characters in the Jodhaa Akbar universe, a film about historical India. She mentions she was drawn to the film because, “it was a Desi film,” and she is Desi, but also she wanted to explore the cultural and religious tensions that the film explores, similar tensions explored in GOT.  Kittya, when telling her fan story, shares how she grew up in Guyana, where she engaged with Indian cultural content. When she moved to the US, she found herself relying on online fandoms to translate Indian television shows. As she continued to read and engage with texts, she found herself drawn to texts “where people were actually talking about foods that I would eat or where people were living in communities like mine, where people spoke that way that I spoke, et cetera.” She also, though, points to realizing an absence of representation in US culture, which she describes as “insidious.”</p>
            <p>The moments when fans describe relating correlate with a lack of normalized representation of their culture, sexuality, and other aspects of their identity. When aspects of fans’ lived experiences and identities are often mis- or not represented in popular culture, fans develop deeper connections with texts that do represent them.</p>

             <h3>Quotes</h3>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so
                   I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And
                   already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They
                   weren't things I was writing about at the time.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong> There are things I don't like about it, but I like it as a little bit of text. It's
                   there in the text, it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love
                   feeling represented." So I wrote that.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think of a place I was there, and this was particularly...I was engaging with political
                   institutions at the time that were much, much bigger than me, particularly family
                   institutions. My family was pretty chill, but running a queer resource center at community
                   college is like, getting that [inaudible 00:24:12]. You would deal with a bunch of
                   people that were writing about the problems for being gay, or feeling like they can't
                   talk about it, or being the only source of information, of being part of an institution
                   that was the only source of information.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>So then I realized that Jodhaa Akbar, which is
                   definitely a Desi film, had a wonderful set of characters that was definitely
                   angsty, but had a wonderfully happy ending. And allowed me to write about something
                   that was kind of dear to my heart as well. Because it was a Desi film. It was one
                   representation in a way, but not necessarily. I think it was just about freeing
                   those religious tensions, and those cultural tensions, and actually attempting
                   to bridge them. Because you have to. Because it's not just
                   about love, or it's not just about anything. It's about your pride, it's about your
                   family's livelihood. All of those kind of come together, you have to do it. You
                   don't want to, but, somehow, you have to. I think it's that gritting of your teeth,
                   and getting on with life that kind of really draws me in.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean that I just don't think I relate to him at the
                   same extent that I relate to Sansa.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And from those three, you can see that they have
                   very female-centered stories. And then, at least all three are those are canonically
                   queer
                   characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
                   go, "Okay, well, I want to dive into that. I want to see how
                   their stories could be different," or, "I just really want to see them in this
                   situation," so I try and write it when I can.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And then, just
                   seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
                   once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
                   not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
                   the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
                   there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.
                   </li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
                   it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
                   since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
                   until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
                   a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
                   decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
                   this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
                   case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
                   Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
                   bit.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, obviously, personal preference aside, I think it
                   was the most fleshed out of Korra's personal relationships with any of the other
                   possible love interests.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>That was an Indian television show that I was
                   watching, and I happened to be looking for ways to continue to consume the show
                   because I'd been watching it back home, but back home I had English subtitles
                   and so on.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And because I grew up in a country
                   where we have a large Indo-Guyanese population, so Indian content was part of our
                   regular air waves and the music and sound that we listened, so it shaped what I was
                   interested in.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But I
                   think with Twilight it was just that phase where you finally find a
                   story that speaks to you, even if you kind of hate it when you look back at it when
                   you're older. But at the time, how
                   Bella was written both as someone who was insular and chooses to form or has a
                   small community and so forth and deals with depression or
                   whatever it is, it just seemed to be something that I could relate to. And so
                   I was both interested in that, and I guess in the power fantasy that she was written
                   to
                   come in to. Usually, at least for me at the time, it wasn't really common to see those
                   characters have that kind of a glow-up, you can say.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think it was more
                   that it was very books for me because I grew up in the Caribbean ... Well, on
                   South America but as socially, politically part of the Caribbean, so most of the
                   content that we were consuming was either shows from the US or whatever, maybe
                   European shows might have filtered through, and that also was the case for the
                   books that we were reading. And while it was the case within school for us to
                   consume Caribbean literature, it was harder to read Caribbean literature as a
                   person on my own.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So it was just discovering a collection of books in my
                   own home from my aunt and my mother and so on, their teachers. And my aunt in particular,
                   she
                   teaches English, and so they had old texts that I found and started reading
                   them. And that's when I began to realize that the books that I had been reading
                   were excluding me. It was something that you sort of knew but you didn't quite
                   know. I guess it comes back to not knowing what you're missing
                   until you finally have it. So when I first read texts were people
                   were actually talking about foods that I would eat or where people were living
                   in communities like mine, where people spoke that way that I spoke, et
                   cetera.
                   Because even though I speak, let's say,
                   like this, how I speak with my family or how I speak with my friends from back
                   home, it's a little different even though ... So, my particular country, we
                   speak English, but it's a particular kind of English. So just
                   seeing that in text and then realizing that the fantasies and so on that I was
                   consuming were ... I don't know, it had these strange things that just didn't quite
                   compute with where I was living. That's where it really clicked for me. And from
                   that point onward, I think that's where I began to see it in everything else. The
                   biggest shift didn't really come until I moved to the US, because back home I was
                   part of the
                   majority, so even though it's absent, you were still seeing yourself in other
                   ways, whether that's being who was teaching you or who was in the news as a
                   politician, et cetera. But here it was a completely different
                   ballgame, so it felt more insidious</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I don't know, it just ... There may have been
                   other works of fiction that never really covered that, but for me in particular that
                   was when Korra just seemed more human.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>You actually get to see an
                   avatar. And yes, Aang did deal with this too, but it's ... I don't know.
                   It's just different for me.
                   Deal with PTSD and depression and just all these changing
                   things. It was interesting.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>everyone has seen someone who they think is
                   all-powerful and infallible, invulnerable to an extent, be ... I don't want to say
                   broken, but be injured in a
                   really drastic way and them not being able to do anything much to help with her
                   recovery in concrete ways.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I'm
                   like, "In what world am I supposed to view this as platonic? I mean, I know I was
                   raised
                   in a pretty fundamentalist Christian kind of environment, but I think I'm seeing
                   here things that I should not be seeing between two [inaudible
                   00:58:53] people." So that's when I became a
                   believer. And the longer I watched the show, the more it seemed to grow.</li>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> When fan authors critique the canonical text, including critiquing the writing, ideologies, identity representation (or lack thereof), and more.</p>
            <p><strong>Number of Codes:</strong> 34</p>
            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The fan authors’ critiques of the canon often point at the actual writing and character arcs portrayed on the show, demonstrating that each author has their own individual interpretations of the show. Some of their interpretations of the show revolve around the “believability” of characters’ experience; fan authors speak to either their own lived experiences or the lived experiences of people within their communities. Other authors point out that the television show writers’ choices reinscribe harmful dominant ideologies with their writing choices. This critique resonates with the inability for some writers to capture particular lived experiences.</p>
            <p>Writegirl and Valk, for example, both critique the GOT’s writers’ choices in season 8. Valk argues that Jaime and Brienne’s love scene contradicts previous aesthetics of their relationship. Specifically, they point to how Brienne is depicted as smaller than Jaime when they kiss, even though Brienne is the taller character. Valk notices that the writers’ and directors’ choices to make Brienne smaller than Jaime reinscribes a heteronormative notion of gender roles — Brienne, as the woman, must be smaller than Jaime, the man.  Writegirl also critiques the GOT’s writers’ treatment of Missandei, arguing that their choice for Missandei to “die in chains, basically in a pissing contest between two White women” erases her liberatory narrative arc that her character followed from earlier seasons.</p>
            <p>TLOK fanfiction authors also critique the writers’ choices. Aria points to how Korra survives through a traumatic injury and battle, which leads her to developed post-traumatic stress disorder. In the show, Korra lives with PTSD for quite some time, but then slowly recovers from it. Aria expresses that she wished the show better represented how people living with PTSD may not recover and must “come to live with,” rather than portraying it as something that can be fixed. Kittya Cullen has a similar critique that the show brushes past mental health; she points to a moment in season 1 that she interprets as Korra contemplating dying from suicide. Korra’s contemplation quickly ends as the show ends. Kittya wishes that the writers let Korra “dwell in the true feeling of that moment” instead of immediately resolving this storyline. Both Kittya and Aria’s critiques points to how the canon misrepresented the lived experiences of people living with disabilities, especially PTSD.</p>

             <h3>Quotes</h3>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Some of the pieces I wrote just no longer work as Homestuck pieces because the characters
                   have been changed, and I was like, "I can't really write this story about two women
                   in love because one of them isn't a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
                   context around Stonewall, and also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just
                   very surface, very basic understanding of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something
                   you recover from, in a way that I was not super comfortable with. And sort of the
                   original text, not sure if you would agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability
                   through the context of being something you come to live with, and come to integrate,
                   and come to find becomes a part of you life, but also something you still struggle
                   with, instead of just, I don't know, a lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you
                   get better, and then you get better and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother
                   you.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so
                   I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And
                   already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They
                   weren't things I was writing about at the time.</li>
                <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I chose the end of Season Three because it's the place where I felt like I was reading
                   a... I felt like engaging with the original text, I was feeling like I wanted something
                   different, I wanted a more deep and meaningful engagement with disability and trauma
                   in this context. Because reading the original text is like, it's there for a while
                   and then they're better? So it was almost the opposite feeling, what do I think this
                   looks like? And so that's why I chose that.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think if you look at A Song of Ice and Fire, technically,
                   more than Game of Thrones, you
                   actually get more of a cultural tension due to just the difference between the
                   North and the South. And all of that. And I do think that George R. R. Martin
                   has kind of perpetuated the idea, simply because he is English. So, the whole
                   idea that in England, where Northerners are tougher and everything than
                   Southerners. And I don't know anything more about it. But I think that's kind of
                   one of the underlying and unconscious biases within the framework of the
                   canon.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, obviously, Season Eight was terrible.
                   That was a given. And the ending did not do anyone any favors.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And second of all, the actual TV show was not doing itself any
                   favors. </li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I actually do remember how unhappy people were that Sansa didn't
                   end with a love interest at the end of Season Eight.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And, obviously, there's a ton of other problems. How [inaudible
                   01:21:42] Daenerys, and Cersei, and Jaime. And a number of other characters.</li>
                <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I could understand why people felt unhappy about it. But at the same time, I
                   think you're beating on the wrong bush here. There's a lot of other problems to deal
                   with within this fandom. And within this canon that we don't particularly need as
                   much as you're putting into it.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I started in college and I had watched most of Avatar, but I
                   don't think I ever quite finished it. And I think this was just before season three
                   came out, I want to say. I'm not totally 100% on that. But my roommate was very much
                   into that, very much in love with Avatar, so she was appalled that I don't think I'd
                   ever finished Avatar, and made me watch that.</li>
                <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Yeah. And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
                   super forced, and then, I didn't like that he cheated on both
                   of them with each other. It was like, "Jeez. No, no. He should not be in a
                   relationship with either of them after this." Yeah. I always felt like maybe Mako
                   should take five steps back, and let's just
                   focus on these two.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think
                   in the first two books, even though Korra does have moments of vulnerability, I
                   guess her experiences are fantastical in a sense.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Korra gets to her lowest point.  The implication is that she's about to jump off a
                   cliff. But
                   we don't really get to dwell in the true feeling of that moment, the have to fix
                   it immediately because of the idea that the show may never get to come back to
                   this point, so we don't get to actually see what that means for
                   her.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think
                   it's just existing personally as a marginalized person. The way that that storyline
                   was handled in LOK, I think I wasn't quite comfortable with it, just the very idea
                   of the movement disappearing because of one man's end. It seems so unrealistic
                   because there was a real situation with inequality there. Because we see that the
                   world has adapted to cater for benders, and we don't quite know non-benders are
                   faring in that world, what kind of opportunities they're having. And based on the
                   conflict that the show raised, it was clear that non-benders were in a position
                   where they weren't having ends meet or they weren't getting the jobs that they hoped
                   to get.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>The universe raises really
                   interesting conversations about inequality and power and change and so forth, but
                   we
                   kind of always see it from the position of the privileged. And I think that's my favorite
                   thing about fandom
                   and fan fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that
                   either there wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important
                   enough to explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always
                   in the forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the
                   world," not just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
                   through.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And
                   you could tell, from a fandom perspective, some people who are cishet won't be able
                   to speak to
                   this, but you could tell that the writer's room was split in
                   how they were portraying the characters because I think they got uncomfortable with
                   how fandom
                   was growing so rapidly and intensely around these two
                   characters, even
                   to the point where they used the black character as a wedge between
                   them. So, just so many layers of so many awful things happening
                   in that show. </li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But we basically had these two
                   actors leaning into it because they didn't have a problem with
                   it, but we see that some of the writers were
                   uncomfortable, or I guess maybe the network or the showrunners were
                   uncomfortable where the story was heading. And so they moved
                   away from what was organically developing to the extent where they took two
                   characters who never said more than a single word to each other, and one of these
                   characters actively disliked the other character, and said, "Hey, we're going to
                   have these two put together. And we are
                   going to have your favorite superhero be shipped with a slave
                   owner. So, yay, have fun with that."</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So
                   when you start off with a show that has ... It's basically girl-next-door, blonde,
                   blue-eyed, sort of
                   hyper-feminine in some ways but also gender non-conforming in other ways super
                   hero dating a
                   black man, or having that black man being put as a love interest when that's
                   usually not the case, especially for that kind of media.
                   And then you break them apart in the
                   second season and conveniently replace him with a white man who just actually
                   makes the character feel terrible and derails her show, and starts to get almost as
                   much screen
                   time as she does even though he's not really an integral part of the show. Just
                   so much went wrong so fast. He was so bad.</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>as like a side note, I think the show really undercut Jaime and Brienne's
                   relationship as well at the end. One of the big ones is like Jaime and Brienne
                   kissed each other and Jaime was suddenly taller than her. I was
                   like, "Boy is a head shorter than her."</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I mean, personally, I think the whole bit where he leaves and comes
                   back is bullshit. Like, I'm sorry, I can't even mince words with that</li>
                <li><strong>Valk: </strong>That would have been a good way to end it, not, we're going to hug
                   each other and we're going to let some rocks fall.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, right when about Season
                   Seven hit, I started getting a little bit upset about the writing in Game of
                   Thrones. And then by the time Season Eight hit, I was just like, "Oh no. No, no, no,
                   no, no. I can't deal with this." I got a bit more involved with writing, because my
                   brain was like, "No, this isn't how it should go. We need to redo all this whole
                   thing." It really started picking up in Season Seven. That was the first time I
                   wrote a Game of Thrones fanfiction. And I believe that was my other OtherWhen
                   series, the first one.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I chose Sansa in particular, and I
                   think you're talking about the Petyr Baelish one, because I felt she suffered a
                   little bit of character assassination.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong> So seeing that, and kind of juxtaposing it against the Sansa
                   we were getting in the show was a little irksome.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I literally got up off the couch and walked away when
                   she got beheaded. I was very upset. It pissed me
                   off that you have a character like Missandei who is very strong, who survives
                   slavery, got out of her chains, became this person who was herself, and then how
                   did she die? She dies in chains, basically in a pissing contest between two
                   white women. That was very, very frustrating and irritating to
                   me.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That seemed completely out of
                   character for me. The whole scene was out of character for me.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So, how do I give her, I hate to say the word, but some
                   of her dignity back? If she has to die, I thought it really should be on her terms.
                   That was kind of the motivation for that.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I adore the Dorne
                   storyline in the books, and they completely butchered it in the show. So, that's why
                   I
                   was like, no Dorne's way smarter than this. So yes, he's going to be the Dorne that
                   you
                   get in the books.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Which was a twist I desperately wanted to happen in the show
                   that didn't happen, and I was a little upset about that</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Missandei deserved
                   better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
                   they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
                   would. And then, [inaudible 00:24:23].</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
                   agency. It seemed like from the time we see her in the Baelish
                   dress, with the feathers on it, which she's actually taking on a mockingbird, that
                   that was a glimpse of a darker Sansa, a more politically savvy Sansa, a more adult
                   Sansa. And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
                   we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
                   that was a little irritating to me.  So I wanted
                   her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
                   supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
                   that.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I just couldn't see a Sansa, even one who was
                   beaten down, agreeing to that. She's still a Stark. She still has her pride. So, I
                   thought of, okay, so what would Sansa do in this situation?</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, there's one scene where he kind of corners her,
                   and it's a lot of Chester the Molester, a bit. It's a little
                   stalker-y.</li>

               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>"I can't really write this story about two women in love because one of them isn't
                     a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>For me, this text begins both as like, I was reading a lot about Stonewall and the
                     context around Stonewall,</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love story
                     about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not make
                     those two pieces meld at the time.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>it was one of those things that was like, "Oh, I love this, I love feeling represented."</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong> And so I was, for me the most natural thing to write about is to write about... Not
                     just homophobia, although this was a story about homophobia, not just homophobia,
                     but this was a story about queerness and politics. And because this was the thing
                     that was radicalizing me</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Asami plays that role, being a person to whom Korra wants to relate, is thrilled to
                     relate, is not scared, or she is a little bit scared to relate, but is she scared
                     to relate in the way that she's scared to relate to other people.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I imagine Asami as having a relatively normal, relatively healthy understanding of
                     the world in a way, having felt like she, not just knowing that a woman can love another
                     woman, because I guess almost every person in this world knows. This is nothing like,
                     Korra is particularly going to have a hard time because of that institution itself.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This is the moment when this becomes one of the early queer relationships in cartoons,
                     a relatively good one. There's nothing particularly problematic about it, it's limited,
                     but it's good.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And there's a degree to which it a queer reading, there's this political tendency
                     to look at fiction and say, "I am going to tell the story you didn't."</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
                     love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
                     stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
                     of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
                     of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
                     "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
                     who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
                     of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think that people writing about suffering and happiness, a lot of things happen
                     in love stories in general, particularly in WlW and MlM stuff.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was laughing at the bottom set for heiress in the middle column, "a-asami" there.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>It's very interesting to me, because I think if you look at any other major
                     fandom, you would probably get male male slash at a much higher rate than you're
                     getting here.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> at least all three are those are canonically queer
                     characters, which are things that now get me really excited and make me want to
                     go,</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And maybe, I think,
                     during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
                     different attitudes in that.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>just
                     seeing the way her relationship sort of evolved with Asami over time, especially
                     once you get into the third season, was like, "Okay, I'm into this. Whether or
                     not they're going for it, I see it." So, it was like, "All right. I and a lot of
                     the people in the fandom seem to agree for some reason, so I'm just going to go
                     there and enjoy that while I'm doing it.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>let's just
                     focus on these two.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>As soon as Asami showed up on the screen, I must have lost
                     it. But it was incredible. I couldn't believe it. I was like, "This is
                     happening, right?" Yeah. I was like, "Jesus."</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>so I really like reading things that are just
                     soft and maybe things aren't so terrible for them where they are, and just sort
                     of getting lost in the idea of, they can just relax. They've been through so
                     much, they deserve a little bit of something that's not going to hurt them, with
                     somebody who definitely wants the same for them, who wants the same for
                     themselves.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>I liked that they
                     weren't immediate, for the most part.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>but they were so good together that I wanted to be able to

                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>So, at the same time,
                     it was also sort of an exploration for me in that I've known I was gay, probably
                     since kindergarten, but I sort of just put it off, put it off, and it wasn't
                     until I started getting into Korrasami that I was like, "Okay, well, I'm meeting
                     a community where this is accepted and this is encouraged even." So, I had
                     decided to come out, and these became sort of two parallels of, "It could be
                     this, or it could be that." Of like, "What is the best case? What is the worst
                     case for maybe how my parents will react?" Thankfully, it leaned more towards
                     Korra's parents than Asami, but it did sort of dip into that a little
                     bit.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Well, again, it was the prompts, but it was
                     also, I have personally been a little conflicted on gender for a while, and it's
                     like my sexuality, it was something that I sort of just say, "Well, I'll get to
                     that when I have the chance."</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>she's living the life that she wanted to live with a person she loves, doing
                     something she loves. And even though it maybe needs to be a little bit more
                     complicated, because of hormones or things like that, but it's not a huge
                     obstacle, it's just a little something to add to the day.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And even though the trans experience is not necessarily one
                     that I know for certain, there's plenty of people in the Korra community, in
                     most online Internet communities, where there's plenty of those people and you
                     see what they're going through and you see how their lives are</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"I want a female ship. Going for it. I don't
                     care whether or not they necessarily gel."</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>"That's a little gayer than it maybe should be," that sort of look. So, a lot
                     of people took that and decided to go with it</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>or at least Korrasami fans, picking
                     up on it and saying, "Okay, well, we don't know when season four is happening,
                     so we're just going to kick off from there and this is what could
                     happen."</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>This is canon, right? This is canon. That's what this looks
                     like</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>especially since, up to that point, there really hadn't been
                     a whole lot of huge representation for female ships.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> Given my own cultural background and
                     the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
                     that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I wasn't
                     quite sure yet how to engage with what was happening in ways that were visible
                     to other people outside of the fan community, the slashfan
                     community.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I just, spending so much time reading so much fanfiction
                     from LOK and then branching out into Steven Universe and moving
                     from Steven Universe into Supergirl, there was
                     just more of an interaction with another side of fandom, the slash side of
                     fandom. I don't know. I think you have to be integrated with others who are
                     looking for more than what's presented, looking for more than what's norm,
                     what's the acceptable way of telling a story of any kind of relationship really.
                     </li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I was like, "Okay. This is pretty blatant. I
                     don't see how anyone is not seeing this."</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I mean, I know I was raised
                     in a pretty fundamentalist Christian kind of environment, but I think I'm seeing
                     here things that I should not be seeing between two [inaudible
                     00:58:53] people."</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>some people who are cishet won't be able to speak to
                     this</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>two
                     actors leaning into it because they didn't have a problem with
                     it</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I'm non-binary, so a lot of my work as I got older started
                     to deal more with gender as well as sexuality, also being
                     bi-sexual.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I was putting them on paper, using another
                     character as the medium and expressing or exploring different ideas in an area
                     where I felt I was kind of safe to do so.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Mainly regarding the pairings that would
                     show up, it would be mainly non-hetero pairings if that makes more sense than
                     just saying a pairing because there would be some exploring of gender and what
                     not with some characters. Or I would definitely be focusing on male-male or
                     female-female relationships as well</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It was around the
                     time when I was questioning whether or not I was non-binary</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I sort of delved into this idea trying to explore Jaime reacquainting himself
                     with these things later on in life, but through a modern lens because I also
                     wanted to be able to relate to it as well.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>also having her there to sort of be a foil and a supportive shoulder for Jaime
                     who was going through a similar thing that maybe she went through as
                     well.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>my own experiences, just exploring the LGBT
                     community in my area</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I really wanted
                     to address the gender issue and the gender questioning and write how the
                     experiences hit the hardest for me when I was thinking about
                     it.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>if you're very new into
                     like trying to question your gender identity, especially being a man, you are at
                     a higher risk of...I should say more so, if you present male than you are at a
                     higher risk of facing violence or any kind of physical outlashing. Be it verbal
                     or physical, but I think it's a lot of like, you learn to be very secretive.
                     You'll act in ways to protect yourself, more than
                     anything.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>trying to work through gender things. I
                     wanted to also try and put someone in the position where they were questioning
                     their gender and actually acting it out, changing their appearance in some way
                     that would fit them better or explore better.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to, I guess write a do-over for some
                     of them about how I would have liked to have that experience with me, like
                     having them knock again and come inside and ask questions and not just kind of
                     leave it right there and not talk again. I wanted to sort of console myself a
                     little bit through it as well as wanted to console Jaime</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I wanted to kind of write it as like a self-fulfilling
                     fantasy as well as like how I would have pictured them actually going through
                     it.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>knowing that I could go back and explore myself with fan
                     fic if I needed to as well.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I ship Sansa and Marjory and I tried to write fic for
                     them</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Renly/Lauris,
                     obviously.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>We just did that, like Brienne was actually fully a lesbian
                     and that she hated people linking her with Jaime. And I'm like, "That's an
                     interesting concept, not canon, but concept." She was fighting people on the
                     dashboard about it with the sort of bigger, than someone who has like facts in
                     front of them would argue. And I'm like, "I understand, but this is your
                     interpretation." People who ship her with Jaime don't hate lesbians. Please, do
                     not try and put this away.</li>

               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>if you read this you'll see homophobia. I can't not publish a story about homophobia.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong> And so I was, for me the most natural thing to write about is to write about... Not
                     just homophobia, although this was a story about homophobia, not just homophobia,
                     but this was a story about queerness and politics. And because this was the thing
                     that was radicalizing me</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And I remember being like, "Oh, these folks are not going to tell a child about queer
                     sexuality." Particularly sexuality is a hard topic, you grow up in that kind of compound
                     in a world where queer identities are looked down on, you're going to come away with
                     this very strange view about that. And you might just be told nothing.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>My family was pretty chill, but running a queer resource center at community college
                     is like, getting that [inaudible 00:24:12]. You would deal with a bunch of people
                     that were writing about the problems for being gay, or feeling like they can't talk
                     about it, or being the only source of information, of being part of an institution
                     that was the only source of information.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And I kind of wanted to say that queerness isn't criminalized in the Northern Water
                     Tribe, or is not criminalized anymore.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>turns out the book I was reading at the time that claimed that knowing someone who
                     was gay had a significant...Or not knowing someone who was gay, but engaging with
                     someone who's gay on the topic of being gay helped significantly with changing someone's
                     political views, or being willing to accept gay people. Turns out that one was actually
                     wrong, like literally the person who put together that study cooked the book.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong> was thinking about New York City around the times of the Stonewall Riots. This is
                     where those politics come in. I was playing with, what does it mean... I was playing
                     with, what's particularly violent political oppression? What are the limits of political
                     oppression in a relatively liberal cosmopolitan society?</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And maybe, I think,
                     during that time, also, gay marriage was legalized, so it was just definitely
                     different attitudes in that.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>A lot of
                     straight people I know will look at a lot of these relationships and say, "Oh,
                     that came from nowhere."</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think it
                     just seemed like the safer option at the time. </li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Korrasami just seems too weird,
                     okay people.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think they got uncomfortable with how fandom
                     was growing so rapidly and intensely around these two
                     characters</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>but we see that some of the writers were
                     uncomfortable, or I guess maybe the network or the showrunners were
                     uncomfortable where the story was heading.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>gender fluid and gender
                     related things, it wasn't really there.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I
                     guess I was thinking about also how I had reacted or how my friends had reacted
                     to when I came out to them.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I
                     don't know why it never picked up. Marjory just walked around the whole show
                     just hitting on everyone. I was like why isn't there more of this? It's
                     literally right here.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Again, it's Renly/Lauris,
                     Sansa/Marjory. Yeah, there's not a lot really on there.</li>

                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>"I can't really write this story about two women in love because one of them isn't
                     a woman anymore, that story doesn't work as a piece."</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>"This is a gender thing going on." I don't buy that there's not homophobia in a world
                     with gender in the like weird way that... In ways that still reflect our I think gender
                     and homophobia [inaudible 00:21:13], the way that we have a sense of gender. Big,
                     capital G Gender. And so I thought like, "What does it mean to have culture in the
                     context of... What does it mean to be a cosmopolitan city where... There's both a
                     degree of marginalization for like the Northern Water Tribe closing... Not so much
                     that rules that are really intended to enforce gender norms are going to be there.
                     And also to be like, "Yeah, there's probably a different understanding of gender in
                     context," yeah.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I'm really interested in the fact that Korra and Mako becomes more common after Korrasami
                     happened.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>you're seeing is a movement from seeing the word girlfriend in a context of a text
                     that's about a set of texts about relationships in a more heterosexual perspective,
                     in a story about women. Because it looks to me that this is a story that, if you see
                     jealous there, that looks like I'm looking at a piece that's from Korra's point of
                     view. But then if I'm looking at boyfriend, I'm also thinking about Korra and Mako.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>just looking at masculinity as almost sexual in the middle there, an almost dangerous.
                     Because a person's understanding of masculinity are sexual, like the second one is
                     a kind of dangerous, like a kind of danger</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Versus like the sexuality in the second one, for feminine as well as that same panel,
                     but it's not like dangerous</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And it's just very interesting to me to
                     see how female male has been so prevalent across all seasons. And to such an
                     extent. And, I mean, obviously, there are a lot of theories about why that
                     is</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I think
                     I obviously can't give an explanation for a lot of these. But I think that they
                     make sense, to a certain extent, because there definitely are a lot more
                     heterosexual relationships within this fandom than I've seen in a lot of other
                     fandoms.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>And I always thought her relationship with Mako felt
                     super forced</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>Initially, it was definitely harder to see
                     that</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>the easy answer is sexism,
                     because everyone sees the main heroine next to a cute boy and decides, "That's
                     good. I'm going to do that," without maybe necessarily putting much more thought
                     into it.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>A lot of
                     straight people I know will look at a lot of these relationships and say, "Oh,
                     that came from nowhere."</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>it was kind of taboo for
                     divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare for a widower to be
                     portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife that he had lost, so
                     it was a combination of really interesting things.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I wasn't
                     quite sure yet how to engage with what was happening in ways that were visible
                     to other people outside of the fan community, the slashfan
                     community.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>She's not a dainty fainting
                     flower that they love.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> At the time, I don't know, it was just that Korra
                     and Mako were what was the norm. And so I think it made sense for some people to
                     only be able to see that happening. I mean, I didn't see the possibility of
                     Korrasami until the very end.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Plus the allocishets tend to dominate
                     fandom in general, so it made sense that they would sort of own the sandbox and
                     everyone else should be playing to the side.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>couldn't quite bring
                     themselves to see what others were seeing when they took the allocishet glasses
                     off.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I'm always on the fence sometimes when I'm talking
                     about how people are seeing or not seeing certain things. Because even with my
                     current fandom, it's like half the people are saying that we're delusional or
                     creating things where there aren't things. And then other times you see these
                     exact phenomena occurring in cishet media.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>because a lot of the media already does a lot of
                     the male-female exploration.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong> lot of their fics also had a lot of like Jaime
                     being the man and Brienne finally being able to let her guard
                     down.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>it was all
                     very incredibly heteronormative. Just their gender roles and Brienne being
                     vulnerable and weak and all that stuff again.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>It went
                     into his relationship with his father, he was caught walking in his mother's red
                     heels and he got very scolded and punished for it.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I do understand the whole
                     like rough, the woman that warms his heart thing. Again, it's all very like
                     romance novel-y prompts when I've tried to find fic and I'm just like, "I'll
                     just write a Nora Roberts novel."</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Most Game of Thrones fanfic is incredibly hetero
                     normative </li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Again, it's Renly/Lauris,
                     Sansa/Marjory. Yeah, there's not a lot really on there.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I know that when I was writing it, there was a lot
                     less fanfic, but you would think even with Jaime and Brienne having that very
                     unique friendship/relationship</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>the show really undercut Jaime and Brienne's
                     relationship as well at the end. One of the big ones is like Jaime and Brienne
                     kissed each other and Jaime was suddenly taller than her.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong> lot of
                     the fics, even with Jaime and Brienne is just depressingly, like, "Wow, if I
                     wanted to read this fic, I'd just go to like any romance section and find
                     it."</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>wonderful knights in their shining armor, these
                     lovely ladies who are just ethereal in their beauty, everything being wrapped up
                     in a bow, happily ever after. Maybe something happens, but someone's always
                     rescued.</li>

               <h3>Quotes</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I remember coming away with this feeling that there is a marginalized subjectivity
                     in the Northern Water Tribe. And so telling this story about difference in culture</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Basically that I think Korra's upbringing is particularly reflective of that culture,
                     yeah.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>"This is a gender thing going on." I don't buy that there's not homophobia in a world
                     with gender in the like weird way that... In ways that still reflect our I think gender
                     and homophobia [inaudible 00:21:13], the way that we have a sense of gender. Big,
                     capital G Gender. And so I thought like, "What does it mean to have culture in the
                     context of... What does it mean to be a cosmopolitan city where... There's both a
                     degree of marginalization for like the Northern Water Tribe closing... Not so much
                     that rules that are really intended to enforce gender norms are going to be there.
                     And also to be like, "Yeah, there's probably a different understanding of gender in
                     context," yeah.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Whereas Korra grows up in this institution, Asami grows up with a relatively politically
                     progressive father.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I imagine Asami as having a relatively normal, relatively healthy understanding of
                     the world in a way, having felt like she, not just knowing that a woman can love another
                     woman, because I guess almost every person in this world knows. This is nothing like,
                     Korra is particularly going to have a hard time because of that institution itself.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because it was a Desi film. It was one
                     representation in a way, but not necessarily. I think it was just about freeing
                     those religious tensions, and those cultural tensions, and actually attempting
                     to bridge them.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>I mean, you need to have that religious, and
                     cultural, and those barriers in order for that to
                     happen.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And then, of course, you have the Targaryen
                     colors, which are black, which are mourning colors according to the Western
                     culture. </li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Where I
                     just didn't translate them into Rajput or Hindi words. Because I just use
                     whatever I knew, because I speak Kannada at home.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And, I mean, there's Rajput culture as well as
                     South Indian culture, as well as there's some random, I think, there's some
                     Bengali culture that I just threw in for the hell of it.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because it's also your
                     culture. You know what you're doing, you know where you're coming from. But we
                     would not do it." And, I mean, the vast majority of them were from the U.K. or
                     the U.S., and they were not from the same culture.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because I was also combining both South Indian and North Indian tropes, to a
                     certain extent. And those weren't necessarily very compatible. And there's a lot
                     of history behind that and everything.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because especially when you're looking at a lot of Indian mothers, and Indian
                     women who get into marriages at a very young age. You have to deal with your
                     husband's family, you have to deal with that entire kind of stigma. About you
                     have to be the one to adjust and to compromise to a far greater extent than your
                     husband.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Where she was
                     just trying to fight it, she was such a perfect child in that culture. And then
                     suddenly she has to kind of leave her culture behind. Or, not leave her culture
                     behind, but adjust to a new culture.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>you
                     actually get more of a cultural tension due to just the difference between the
                     North and the South. And all of that. And I do think that George R. R. Martin
                     has kind of perpetuated the idea, simply because he is English. So, the whole
                     idea that in England, where Northerners are tougher and everything than
                     Southerners. And I don't know anything more about it. But I think that's kind of
                     one of the underlying and unconscious biases within the framework of the
                     canon.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Especially that religious tension between Jon and
                     Sansa. And have that difference, where both of them and neither of them are
                     willing to compromise on that.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I mean, there are
                     cultural differences within, I mean, people that I've grown up with in India,
                     and people in the U.S. And even though you're living side by side, that doesn't
                     necessarily mean that you have the same cultural background.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And, I mean, we don't know if she relies more on
                     her religion because she left her homeland, and came to the North. And just
                     wanted some desperate way, something to rely on that's her family, or that
                     reminded her of home. But to me, at least, I can imagine, especially the actual
                     Jodhaa, going to Akbar's Islamic court. And basically being all alone, and not
                     having very many allies. And finding some sort of a solace in her religion of
                     Hinduism.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because as much as she's giving him the gift,
                     she's also giving him his name. And she's stepping across her own cultural
                     boundaries to help him with that, which Jon doesn't completely
                     understand.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong> And adjusting to that
                     is a huge, almost, culture shock to people.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And has to go to a foreign country without any
                     support, and any of her own traditions. She's the one that's upheld every single
                     tradition she has ever done. And especially when you're looking at the Hindu
                     culture, it's very difficult to uphold them.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>That was an Indian television show that I was
                     watching, and I happened to be looking for ways to continue to consume the show
                     because I'd been watching it back home, but back home I had English subtitles
                     and so on.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So I got into forums and fans would
                     translate for those of us who didn't speak Hindi.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>it was kind of taboo for
                     divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare for a widower to be
                     portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife that he had lost, so
                     it was a combination of really interesting things.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I grew up in a country
                     where we have a large Indo-Guyanese population, so Indian content was part of our
                     regular air waves and the music and sound that we listened, so it shaped what I was
                     interested in.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I grew up in the Caribbean ... Well, on
                     South America but as socially, politically part of the Caribbean, so most of the
                     content that we were consuming was either shows from the US or whatever, maybe
                     European shows might have filtered through, and that also was the case for the
                     books that we were reading. And while it was the case within school for us to
                     consume Caribbean literature, it was harder to read Caribbean literature as a
                     person on my own.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And my aunt in particular, she
                     teaches English, and so they had old texts that I found and started reading
                     them. And that's when I began to realize that the books that I had been reading
                     were excluding me. It was something that you sort of knew but you didn't quite
                     know. </li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>So when I first read texts were people
                     were actually talking about foods that I would eat or where people were living
                     in communities like mine, where people spoke that way that I spoke, et
                     cetera.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Because even though I speak, let's say,
                     like this, how I speak with my family or how I speak with my friends from back
                     home, it's a little different even though ... So, my particular country, we
                     speak English, but it's a particular kind of English.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>because back home I was part of the
                     majority, so even though it's absent, you were still seeing yourself in other
                     ways, whether that's being who was teaching you or who was in the news as a
                     politician, et cetera</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But here it was a completely different
                     ballgame, so it felt more insidious</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> Given my own cultural background and
                     the cultural background of the world in general, I was pretty surprised about
                     that, so I started consuming fics and reading the show</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I mean, I know I was raised
                     in a pretty fundamentalist Christian kind of environment, but I think I'm seeing
                     here things that I should not be seeing between two [inaudible
                     00:58:53] people."</li>

                   in communities like mine, where people spoke that way that I spoke, et
                   cetera.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>because back home I was part of the
                   majority, so even though it's absent, you were still seeing yourself in other
                   ways, whether that's being who was teaching you or who was in the news as a
                   politician, et cetera</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>both as a black person and as a woman, it was
                   just important for me to recognize that in text and get around to exploring what
                   that might have meant for other characters who weren't within the Circle of the
                   Avatar and had powerful connections.</li>
                <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> dating a
                   black man, or having that black man being put as a love interest when that's
                   usually not the case, especially for that kind of media.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Kind of like, who is Missandei? If you take
                   away slavery, and her being Daenerys' friend, who is this person? What is the
                   one thing that would be important to her?</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I don't know if I was a former slave. The one thing I
                   would be sure of when I got my freedom was, I will never be made a slave again
                   in any way, shape or form. So what does that translate into? That translates
                   into, you're not going to use me. I'm not going to stand to be abused
                   anymore.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Missandei deserved
                   better, as you've already talked about. She did. So did Grey Worm. I can't believe
                   they took that pairing from me. I thought that if any pairing would last, that one
                   would.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>she believes in a world
                   without slavery. And after having been a slave and experienced freedom, that's
                   something she'd want for everybody. I hate to say it, Harriet Tubman, how many
                   times did she go back and she got slaves and ran them back out? Simply because
                   I'm free, no one should be in bondage, even if it's a personal risk to myself,
                   to my life, that is a risk I will take, because everyone should be free. And I
                   think as a former slave, Missandei really would have that
                   sentiment.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>as a slave, as someone who's been freed, I can't imagine her ever wanting to
                   be in a situation where somebody would be using her against her will. And that would
                   be one thing I imagine you would promise yourself.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And for her of course it's more extreme,
                   from being someone who was taken from freedom and put into slavery, lived a
                   decade plus as a slave, not having a will of their own, and then suddenly
                   getting that will back. No one's ever taking that from me. Like I said, I've
                   found myself. Now that I've found myself again, and I can be myself, I will die
                   myself.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>it
                   was talking about how former slaves, they go through this process of not believing
                   that they're free, and not believing that they're free, and not believing that
                   they're free. And eventually, they get to a
                   point where it sticks in their head, that this is freedom. This is what they
                   have. No one can control them. And then, they get very, very almost violently
                   independent, where no one's going to tell me what to do. You can't tell me what
                   to do. No one's going to do that to me.</li>
                <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>They get this burst of a sense of self, a
                   sense of purpose. And I thought that was very beautiful, that there are people
                   who can go through all that type of trauma, and they can get there, and they can
                   fully bloom. And I always saw Missandei as kind of that character, this
                   character who had gone through all of that to the point where here she is,
                   standing tall as a character that knows her own worth, knows her own
                   personage.</li>

               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Given this is a proportion, I don't know if [inaudible 00:57:24] but more people as
                     a fandom and those few people aren't interested in talking about race in ways that
                     people who had been there before were, and those people who were there before continued
                     to talk about race, or if there is an effectively gentrifying mmoment that a white
                     fandom comes in, pushes out a fandom of color.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Because, obviously, race bending is, and can
                     be, very racist if not done in a very respectful manner.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>she's maybe not as white as everybody else in
                     Republic City, and she's got these really bight eyes.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I grew up in the Caribbean ... Well, on
                     South America but as socially, politically part of the Caribbean, so most of the
                     content that we were consuming was either shows from the US or whatever, maybe
                     European shows might have filtered through, and that also was the case for the
                     books that we were reading. And while it was the case within school for us to
                     consume Caribbean literature, it was harder to read Caribbean literature as a
                     person on my own.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And my aunt in particular, she
                     teaches English, and so they had old texts that I found and started reading
                     them. And that's when I began to realize that the books that I had been reading
                     were excluding me. It was something that you sort of knew but you didn't quite
                     know. </li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But here it was a completely different
                     ballgame, so it felt more insidious</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Because even when
                     you talk about what characters are bound to get more attention and more
                     interesting and so on and so forth, when you look at fandom in general you'll
                     find that when those characters are black or just generally a person of color in
                     comparison to a character being white, that people are least particular when the
                     fandom's dominated by white faces and so forth. They are more likely to explore
                     those characters and to humanize them and to want to get to know them better,
                     while other characters and what their hopes and dreams and ideas might be for
                     the world are pushed to the side.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>even
                     to the point where they used the black character as a wedge between
                     them</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And we are
                     going to have your favorite superhero be shipped with a slave
                     owner.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And then you break them apart in the
                     second season and conveniently replace him with a white man who just actually
                     makes the character feel terrible</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It pissed me
                     off that you have a character like Missandei who is very strong, who survives
                     slavery, got out of her chains, became this person who was herself, and then how
                     did she die? She dies in chains, basically in a pissing contest between two
                     white women.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Mostly she seems to almost
                     be absent from things. She's window dressing. She's there, she doesn't speak, or she
                     speaks, it's one or two sentences in the entire fic.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>you get those fics where she
                     either has none of those, she's either not there, or she has really none of those
                     attributes. She's kind of just a yes person. Yes, Khaleesi, no Khaleesi, yes my
                     queen.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Because there aren't really a lot of
                     fics that focus on her as a character at all.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
                     seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
                     woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
                     anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
                     back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
                     Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
                     slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
                     she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
                     jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
                     great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
                     I've seen it before.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>No, you
                     would have fit in well with them. You may think that you're better, you may
                     think that you're better than people from Astapor. You may think that you're
                     better than slave owners and all this, that, and the other, but in the end you
                     are not. You are exactly like them</li>

                     women who get into marriages at a very young age. You have to deal with your
                     husband's family, you have to deal with that entire kind of stigma. About you
                     have to be the one to adjust and to compromise to a far greater extent than your
                     husband.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Which is, "Yes, I'm miserable. I want you to be miserable. But how am I going
                     to be miserable for?" You need to let some things go, you need to move on past
                     the injustices... I need to move past the injustices that I have
                     faced.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>the easy answer is sexism,
                     because everyone sees the main heroine next to a cute boy and decides, "That's
                     good. I'm going to do that," without maybe necessarily putting much more thought
                     into it.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>But even Katara in the beginning, it was kind of frowned upon for her to use
                     waterbending beyond healing</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> derails her show, and starts to get almost as much screen
                     time as she does even though he's not really an integral part of the show. Just
                     so much went wrong so fast. He was so bad.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>But there would definitely be some push
                     back,</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I think that reflected a lot of her issues with not being able
                     to fulfill the role that she was supposed to play with her father with being the
                     heir, giving him a son and all these things.</li>

                     all of that.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>the show really undercut Jaime and Brienne's
                     relationship as well at the end. One of the big ones is like Jaime and Brienne
                     kissed each other and Jaime was suddenly taller than her.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then, for whatever reason, they backed off of it. And then the next thing
                     we see her, she's just kind of sitting there asking questions, looking dull. And
                     that was a little irritating to me.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I always thought he kind of saw her,
                     especially in the beginning as, he called her a little bird. Like, "I see that your
                     parents never prepared you for this. Your best safe kept in a cage locked away, and
                     you
                     can just sing to people."</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, there's one scene where he kind of corners her,
                     and it's a lot of Chester the Molester, a bit. It's a little
                     stalker-y.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Petyr would relish that. He
                     does everything he can to get her into trusting him, and thinking of him as her
                     friend, and I would do anything for you, and that's really, really creepy. It's
                     always a surprise to me when I see Petyr Baelish, Sansa Stark fics especially
                     ones where it's not manipulative, and coercive, and creepy, I'm like, "What are

                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Okay, my first guess would be that women who love women will write about women who
                     love women, want to tell stories that have happy endings. I think in a lot of the
                     stories we see in literature are of our destruction as a moral point, or the echoes
                     of authority. That doesn't mean that all of the stories that we see that are echoes
                     of stories are intended as seeing those moral and political tellings, they're just,
                     "That's what our culture tells us." A lesbian love story, so retelling... If women
                     who love women retell stories of women who love women, they're going to tell a lot
                     of stories that are about being happy, at least in my opinion.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>To any women, adjusting to that is
                     difficult.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Which is, "Yes, I'm miserable. I want you to be miserable. But how am I going

                     her as much as she is owed when she's going into a
                     marriage.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>when I was first getting into the fandom,
                     one of my friends basically told me that the women in this are really
                     strong.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>Like, you have Sansa, who
                     is conventionally pretty, but she also has, on an internal level, she just kind
                     of lives with whatever society expects of her. Whereas, Brienne is not
                     conventionally pretty, so she has to find another way of gaining power in her
                     world.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And Sansa, despite the fact that as a young
                     child she wanted all of that, in the end she got power, and the ability to make
                     sure that nobody hurt her.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>And I think
                     there are other ways that the show actually showed that with the sexual
                     liberation for women, and the feminist liberation for Arya and
                     everything.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>that they have
                     very female-centered stories.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> And for Korra, she's an imposing
                     figure, whether or not she means to be. She's got the muscles</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>it was kind of taboo for
                     divorcees who were women to get remarried, and it was rare for a widower to be
                     portrayed as someone who was intensely devoted to the wife that he had lost, so
                     it was a combination of really interesting things.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I guess in the power fantasy that she was written to
                     come in to. Usually, at least for me at the time, it wasn't really common to see those
                     characters have that kind of a glow-up, you can say.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>both as a black person and as a woman, it was
                     just important for me to recognize that in text and get around to exploring what
                     that might have meant for other characters who weren't within the Circle of the
                     Avatar and had powerful connections.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>With gender roles in particular,
                     I think it's fascinating that within the Avatar universe, we got to see all
                     these really powerful girl and women characters who were, for the most part,
                     respected, at least in later years.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> So it was
                     interesting to see all these female characters get to be complex and powerful
                     and not have that held against them,</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>we have Korra, who is the avatar, and she is this
                     figure who is not the conventional or gender-conforming version of femininity
                     that we're accustomed to. She's allowed to be athletic and walk around in pants
                     without concerns about what others are thinking. Even though she does think
                     about her gender presentation, it comes from a place that's not her considering
                     herself inadequate, but because she saw other people I guess idolized in this
                     particular form of femininity being expressed, so we see Korra and we see Lin
                     and we see Sue and Kuvira, and they're all these women who either have power or
                     they're dealing with their own traumas or they have complex relationships with
                     their mothers, and they have complex relationships with their children as well,
                     if they do have children, and so forth.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Korra is an avatar who's a
                     woman.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It's basically girl-next-door, blonde, blue-eyed, sort of
                     hyper-feminine in some ways but also gender non-conforming in other ways super
                     hero</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>obviously they wouldn't be having as
                     much of a, you know Brienne wouldn't be considered as horrifying as she was
                     considered in the original text because she was considered man-ish. In modern
                     day context, it's not always encouraged, based on what kind of family you came
                     from, women are often allowed to be tom boys more than vice
                     versa.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I made her a little bit more comfortable in
                     her skin than Jaime</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I was just not really feeling it, so I wrote my
                     own instead.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>he always had a very strange affinity, but
                     like an affinity for femininity. Weirdly enough, like he loved his mother, he
                     loved Cersei, but he was always very partial to seeing things from their point
                     of view.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>Jaime had this big, beautiful wife that was taller than him
                     and he's like, "Look at my beautiful wife. Isn't she huge, ask him, and
                     wonderful?"</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>willing to not listen to him, who
                     understood that, this person is not my friend. This person is strictly
                     manipulative. He's going to take me somewhere that I don't want to go, so my
                     only choice is to find the strength in me that she has, and say, "Okay, I'll
                     run. If it means I have to die, I'm not going to let him use me for whatever his
                     ends are."</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I wanted her to have a little bit more
                     agency.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So I wanted
                     her to get a little more agency, especially when she found out who she was
                     supposed to be meeting. I didn't see Sansa ever agreeing to
                     that.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>that's my choice. But it won't be going back
                     to a ruined Winterfell to marry a legitimized bastard.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>he would never allow that, because he
                     wants control of her, and that is something that she realizes, because she's not
                     an idiot.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's re-discovered her strength. She's
                     done something that she didn't think she could do.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>That was kind of that whole, what that
                     episode was about was Sansa really re-discovering herself, and what she could
                     do.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>So really, Sansa's really forced to grow up,
                     and she's really forced to see all these stories as exactly what they are.
                     They're just stories.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>What I was afraid of, I should never have
                     been afraid of, what I wanted was the thing I should have been worried about.
                     She's really kind of flipped the script in her own mind.</li>

                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>He's a radical, he tries to overthrow his government, make the world a more equitable
                     and fair place. It's self-interested, he's a bourgeois radical, but I wouldn't have
                     said that at the time.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>a lot of my understanding of Hiroshi as a bourgeois radical is that I'm not going
                     to have a [inaudible 00:30:36], because I don't really have a sense of class politics
                     at the time, or have the beginnings of that study</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>growing up with the rich father,
                     she has certain expectations placed on her and where she's going to go in her
                     life according to that company, so she has to be sort of poised and on her toes
                     all the time.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She was definitely never really prepared for court
                     life.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
                     seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
                     woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
                     anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
                     back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
                     Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
                     slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
                     she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
                     jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
                     great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
                     I've seen it before.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>No, you

                     think that you're better than people from Astapor. You may think that you're
                     better than slave owners and all this, that, and the other, but in the end you

               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It's a piece about about trauma... And it [inaudible 00:05:20], that this isn't obviously.
                     It's a piece about trauma and it's a piece about, what does it mean... Really they're
                     both pieces about what it means to be disabled.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong> also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just very surface, very basic understanding
                     of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something you recover from, in a way that I
                     was not super comfortable with. And sort of the original text, not sure if you would
                     agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability through the context of being something
                     you come to live with, and come to integrate, and come to find becomes a part of you
                     life, but also something you still struggle with, instead of just, I don't know, a
                     lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you get better, and then you get better
                     and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother you.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wrote about suicide at a time where I was not ready to talk about it, as a writer.
                     I'm still not sure I can actually talk about suicide now, in a way that's beneficial
                     or useful for me. I'm not sure now I can do that now, or could not do it now, but
                     I could not do it at the time, or I couldn't do it in a way that was healthy. I know
                     I wrote it that it would seem therapeutic, but I also was being retraumatized, and
                     I didn't say that obviously in the tags.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But I also struggled because I didn't know how to write about my own trauma, and so
                     I tried to write about trauma in ways that other people were experiencing it. And
                     already the text engaged with that, and those weren't really authentic to me. They
                     weren't things I was writing about at the time.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>It had two epic story arcs that I didn't know how to integrate, both this love story
                     about disability, and it was this story about queer politics, and I could not make
                     those two pieces meld at the time.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I did consult with some folks when I was writing some texts about trauma, because
                     I was like... I wasn't comfortable writing that.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I think I was just engaging with the text's portrayal of trauma.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wasn't telling you things that had happened in the past, to teach you what happened
                     in the past. I was saying, "This is what's haunting the characters, this is what the
                     characters can't escape from in a very physical, visceral fashion." Well maybe physical
                     might be the wrong word, you know what, I'm okay with it, body and mind, if it makes
                     sense.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I was trying to write a story that engaged with trauma and felt authentic and didn't
                     make trauma seem like the end of the world. Because the binary that's in a lot of
                     literature is either like, "Oh, you either overcame trauma, or you are doomed to misery
                     forever." And I was trying to find some middle ground, trying to tell a story that
                     felt authentic.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>Because I imagine Korra's pain is seeing the cost of her new trauma after time, because
                     her being injured, being in a place where you are tortured to death as a vulnerability.
                     Every time you experience that pain, I imagine that that's a place that engagement
                     is a struggle after time when you're in that pain. So it's an ordeal for Korra to
                     dress herself.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>it's not really about romance as much as it is about feeling connected in a genuine
                     way to people, that that central theme, building a life worth living after injury,
                     or after trauma, is finding an authentic realtionship with people.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>because Korra's definitely, she's
                     traumatized.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>she's trying to have a good experience and maybe power
                     through it, but then, in that brief lapse where she forgets that she's tied down
                     and then she tries to sit up, it's sort of like a muscle memory thing, where
                     she's back there the last time she was chained up and couldn't
                     move.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>
                     Bella was written both as someone who was insular and chooses to form or has a
                     small community and so forth and deals with depression</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>we get to see Korra, who is
                     this all-powerful person, come to grips with what she might be like after having
                     this really terrible thing happen to her and want sort of responsibilities she once
                     had, and how it's still there, but she has all these other things she now has to
                     deal with as well, like her mental health and her physical recovery and so
                     forth.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>It's just different for me.
                     Deal with PTSD and depression and just all these changing
                     things.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I don't want to say broken, but be injured in a
                     really drastic way and them not being able to do anything much to help with her
                     recovery in concrete ways.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>to be someone who builds and creates
                     with the purpose of fixing or making better, but then not being able to do so for
                     someone within your personal life.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>when I was writing, I wasn't very well-versed in
                     not just having a limb missing as a disability, but also how advanced the
                     prosthetics were and if they could hold things</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>I would definitely
                     want to go more into his disability as well as his prosthetic and how it worked
                     more.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually had to do a bit of
                     research on some of the fic, for things like trauma, and how people respond to
                     trauma. Especially in the case of Sansa and Missandei, how do people overcome

               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong> also I was reading a piece about PTSD, and it was just very surface, very basic understanding
                     of trauma and PTSD in particular, like something you recover from, in a way that I
                     was not super comfortable with. And sort of the original text, not sure if you would
                     agree. And so I wanted to talk about disability through the context of being something
                     you come to live with, and come to integrate, and come to find becomes a part of you
                     life, but also something you still struggle with, instead of just, I don't know, a
                     lot of us have seen the story a lot like, you get better, and then you get better
                     and you win. And then one day it doesn't bother you.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong> You hear stories about how people
                     try and be helpful and just make situations worse</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong> The implication is that she's about to jump off a cliff. But
                     we don't really get to dwell in the true feeling of that moment, the have to fix
                     it immediately because of the idea that the show may never get to come back to
                     this point, so we don't get to actually see what that means for
                     her.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>when I was writing, I wasn't very well-versed in
                     not just having a limb missing as a disability, but also how advanced the
                     prosthetics were and if they could hold things</li>

               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I guess it was actually about immigration, it's just I never really ever got around
                     to doing a piece about immigration system, but somebody had a bad take about immigration
                     in America in a piece of fanfic and I was like, "God, that's a really bad understanding
                     of that friend. That is utopian and wrong."</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I wrote about suicide at a time where I was not ready to talk about it, as a writer.
                     I'm still not sure I can actually talk about suicide now, in a way that's beneficial
                     or useful for me. I'm not sure now I can do that now, or could not do it now, but
                     I could not do it at the time, or I couldn't do it in a way that was healthy. I know
                     I wrote it that it would seem therapeutic, but I also was being retraumatized, and
                     I didn't say that obviously in the tags.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I did consult with some folks when I was writing some texts about trauma, because
                     I was like... I wasn't comfortable writing that.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>And it was about violence, so I don't just mean violence as a method of resistance,
                     I mean violence as a thing that people survive.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But also a man who genuinely is providing aid and comfort and resources for fighting
                     for what he views as liberation, and that liberation's probably genuine at some level.
                     I think it's fair to say that there is a political bender-like supremacy at the beginning.
                     I mean there is, we know there's a bender supremacy at the beginning of The Legend
                     of Korra.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>But the other thing I wanted to talk about is, what are politicians willing to give
                     up for their family, and what are they not?</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>You could do what, when and where, the idea that a politician can't really save the
                     world. I don't know if I was all the way to, "We have to do it," yet, but I think
                     I'm getting there.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>This was written obviously before Donald Trump becomes President, and I could see
                     all sorts of things about reaction again. But I was seeing the reaction, I was scared.
                     I don't know where I got this, there was something bad was coming. I knew that I had
                     that sense of fear, so I was writing about... I guess writing a little bit about,
                     how do we fight back when things get worse?</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I'd write it as a story that talks about immigration, and talks about sweeping panic
                     and fear that spill off of that. I'd probably talk about gender through those lenses,
                     and I'd probably talk about humanity in a slightly more complex... I'd probably make
                     it a story that... I'd probably both use modern messages to say that, I'd probably
                     talk more about police state, and police state as endless spying networks where you
                     don't know when you're being spied on and when you're not, and endless police states</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong> so much MlM stuff is kind of uncomfortable? A lot it's very clearly written by women.</li>
                  <li><strong>Aria: </strong>I don't really understand ABO [alpha, beta, omega] as in general, so I can't talk.
                     They're not as inherently sexual. They definitely struck me as relatively sexual</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong> But it was, I
                     think, mostly due to the kind of deep rage that I was feeling over the entire
                     Democratic Primaries over the past couple of months. And almost the past year.
                     In which everything felt very much like a lot of talk, and not a lot of doing.
                     And at some point, you need some catharsis. And kind of putting it out into
                     fiction and seeing something changing. Or, not even seeing something changing.
                     But seeing people trying to effect change, and willing to fight for that change
                     felt very important to me. And basically that entire fanfic is kind of born out
                     of that seething, massive, "I want to see something happening."</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>From either my own culture because, of course,
                     this is partially my own culture.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dialux: </strong>this core feeling that they cannot get rid of,
                     that the world has done them a huge injustice. And as much as it's cathartic to
                     see that in fanfic, I also feel like if you go through life like that, it's a
                     very difficult way of going through life.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>it's a common trope in a lot of fanfiction communities, is the student-teacher
                     ... What is that? Student-teacher pairing, whatever. My dad is a teacher, so the
                     idea of that has always just absolutely not been something that I want to
                     encourage, and it just isn't good, so I don't like writing that, I don't like
                     reading it.</li>
                  <li><strong>GillyWulf: </strong>You look out your window and things are just not
                     good a lot of the time,</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>how these shows and books and games et cetera were failing us, whether it
                     was in terms of the content or the representation or just releasing new things like
                     thought arcs that weren't followed through on.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>Because even though I speak, let's say,
                     like this, how I speak with my family or how I speak with my friends from back
                     home, it's a little different even though ... So, my particular country, we
                     speak English, but it's a particular kind of English.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And especially for certain characters who are ... I'm
                     not sure how I'm thinking of this, but I think what I'm thinking of is where the
                     audience may usually dismiss them or not consider them worthy of further
                     exploration. </li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I
                     guess who is an ... I wouldn't say an abuser because there isn't that dynamic
                     for them. But in the way that the relationship shifts from love and care to an
                     act of violence ...</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>And I think that's my favorite thing about fandom
                     and fan fiction, how fans sort of delve into all these areas in canon that
                     either there wasn't time to explore or it didn't really seem to be important
                     enough to explore, so things like inequality. When I write now, it's just always
                     in the forefront, "How can I better represent experiences of people in the
                     world," not just for myself, but for other people, what they're going
                     through.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>I think,
                     and I'll probably go with my own fandom experiences, it just comes back to how
                     the world is constructed externally. So just even the idea of imagining inside
                     of what was placed before us, it takes a special kind of familiarity with the
                     boarders of the world to imagine a world that is different from what is
                     presented to you.</li>
                  <li><strong>Kittya Cullen: </strong>that people were so willing to see all these other,
                     in some ways really twisted, relationship dynamics,</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>you don't really understand romance all
                     typically well. It's all very idealized.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>it was one of
                     the first pairings, I should add the first male-female pairing, the first hetero
                     pairing that I felt emotionally invested in to a point where I was
                     surprised.</li>
                  <li><strong>Valk: </strong>A lot of incest. An exorbitant amount of
                     incest, like beyond what I even take it. I'm typically very do what you want,
                     but even now, I'm just like don't like that.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>willing to not listen to him, who
                     understood that, this person is not my friend. This person is strictly
                     manipulative. He's going to take me somewhere that I don't want to go, so my
                     only choice is to find the strength in me that she has, and say, "Okay, I'll
                     run. If it means I have to die, I'm not going to let him use me for whatever his
                     ends are."</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>he would never allow that, because he
                     wants control of her, and that is something that she realizes, because she's not
                     an idiot.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>She's really
                     seeing Cersei for the creature Cersei is, beyond just being kind of a high-born
                     woman in Westeros. She's seeing the monster that's inside Cersei. Cersei will do
                     anything. She will do anything to maintain power, she will do anything to get
                     back at her enemies, even if it means murder, blackmail, et cetera. And I think
                     Missandei coming from a society where no one would have to hide that from their
                     slaves. She sees it. Like I know you, I've seen masters exactly like you. And
                     she's really recognizing the monster that's in Cersei outside of all of her
                     jewels, outside of her gowns, outside of her façade of being this queen and
                     great lady. It's like, no, you're really this evil thing, and I know it because
                     I've seen it before.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>It's kind of like a, "I know that you know that I know
                     that you know" moment. Like, I see you. You can't hide from me.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>as a slave, as someone who's been freed, I can't imagine her ever wanting to
                     be in a situation where somebody would be using her against her will. And that would
                     be one thing I imagine you would promise yourself.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually had to do a bit of
                     research on some of the fic, for things like trauma, and how people respond to
                     trauma. Especially in the case of Sansa and Missandei, how do people overcome
                     certain difficulties after being in these different positions?</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, mostly
                     it was Googling, recovering from trauma. I did a little bit of research on former
                     slaves, to see their mindset.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>And then with Sansa, just how people recover
                     from abusive and traumatic relationships, and things like that. The stages of
                     recovery.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>I actually liked
                     Sandor Clegane, Sansa Stark as a pairing, whether it's through platonic, whether
                     it's romantic, et cetera.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Yeah, there's one scene where he kind of corners her,
                     and it's a lot of Chester the Molester, a bit. It's a little
                     stalker-y.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Sansa, Petyr, I've always hated that one, simply because he's grooming. It's
                     very obvious.</li>
                  <li><strong>WriteGirl: </strong>Petyr would relish that. He
                     does everything he can to get her into trusting him, and thinking of him as her
                     friend, and I would do anything for you, and that's really, really creepy. It's
                     always a surprise to me when I see Petyr Baelish, Sansa Stark fics especially
                     ones where it's not manipulative, and coercive, and creepy, I'm like, "What are
                     you guys seeing in that?" That's just odd.</li>
